				<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Create a database with one table for 
				your business. Make sure it has no unnecessary redundancy. Keep 
				your database small for demonstration purposes with just a few 
				columns and a few rows of data. Store your database in your web 
				folder. Also write a sample query relevant to your business, and 
				save it in your database. Describe your database on your a2 page 
				by using the notation TABLENAME (attribute1,attribute2,…), and 
				also in English. Describe your query on your a2 page by writing 
				your query in SQL, and in English.<br />
				<strong>A1.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Create a static data page containing the 
				response to your query. Save it in your folder. Create a link 
				from your a2 page to your data page.<br />
				<strong>A2.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Add a second table to your database. 
				Make sure it is also non-redundant. Write a two-table query. 
				Save it in your database. Describe the new table on your a2 page 
				by using the notation of Question 1, and also in English. 
				Describe the new query on your a2 page by writing it in SQL, and 
				also in English.<br />
				<strong>A3.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q4.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Read the article on 
				<a href="a2_direct_marketing.html" target="_blank">Direct Marketing</a> and explain how Target determines if someone is 
				pregnant. <strong>b.</strong> What is relationship marketing? 
				How is it different from direct marketing? <strong>c.</strong> 
				Why is relationship marketing more desirable than mass 
				marketing? Why was mass marketing more desirable in the past? 
				What changed? <strong>d.</strong> How can you use relationship 
				marketing in your business to improve customer service?<br />
				<strong>A4. </strong>Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Create a dynamic data page, and a link 
				to it from your main page.<br />
				<strong>A5.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Create an interactive data page, and a 
				link to it from your main page.<br />
				<strong>A6.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Stock markets can be used to make 
				predictions. Go to <a href="http://www.hsx.com" target="_blank">www.hsx.com</a> 
				and see how they use a stock market to predict the success of 
				new movies. Register and buy stock in various movies. Provide a 
				screenshot of your purchases on your web page. Report on your 
				web page how the market operates and how you could use this 
				strategy in your business. Alternatively use
				<a href="http://www.hubdub.com" target="_blank">www.hubdub.com</a> to predict 
				news items, and answer the same questions.<br />
				<strong>A7.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q8.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain how online 
				stores can take advantage of the services provided by physical 
				stores? How can physical stores respond? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Read the article titled “<a href="a2_google_vs_amazon.html" target="_blank">Google vs Amazon</a>” and explain how 
				Google intends to take advantage of the existing physical stores 
				to create an online store? <strong>c.</strong> Explain how you 
				can create synergies between physical and online stores in your 
				business, if possible. If not possible, give another example of 
				a business successfully creating synergies between online and 
				physical stores.<br />
				<strong>A8.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q9.</strong> a. Read the article on Culturomics and 
				explain how Google’s Digitized Book database can be used to 
				understand historical and cultural trends. <strong>b.</strong> 
				Explain how, using the same techniques, Google’s Search data can 
				be used to make predictions about the future. <strong>c.</strong> 
				Explain how you can use such historical trends and future 
				predictions in your business strategy, with an example. <strong>
				d.</strong> Use Google Ngram Viewer to plot some historical and 
				cultural trends related to your business. For example, you can 
				plot how the relative emphasis on wireless internet and wired 
				internet changed during the last 20 years. Provide a screen shot 
				of your graph on your web page.<br />
				<strong>A9.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q10.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Write a negative 
				query. Save it in your database. Describe the query on your web 
				page in English and in SQL. Be careful with negative queries. If 
				it can also be written without the NOT IN feature, then it is 
				not a negative query! <strong>b.</strong> Give an example of a 
				possible database table in your business that includes an 
				unnecessary redundancy. Make sure it is not a trivial redundancy 
				that duplicates a complete row (entity) or a complete column 
				(attribute). Describe your table by using the notation TABLENAME 
				(attribute1, attribute2, …), and listing some of its contents in a 
				table format. Identify the redundancy by using specific values 
				listed in your table, and state explicitly how many times it is 
				stored. Explain how you would eliminate that redundancy. 
				Describe the new non-redundant database using the same notation 
				and show its contents using the same table format. You don’t 
				have to actually create this table in MS ACCESS.<br />
				<strong>A10.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q11.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain the 
				fundamental tradeoff between inconsistency and information 
				overload in organizational decision-making. How is it related to 
				the centralization-decentralization debate? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Can organizational databases improve centralized decision 
				making? How? <strong>c.</strong> Do network effects tip the 
				balance towards centralization or decentralization according to 
				Braess’ Paradox? <strong>d.</strong> Braess uses highways to 
				demonstrate his paradox. Do highways have network effects? What 
				kind? <strong>e.</strong> Braess argues that wide spread 
				adoption of new and improved technologies may leave everyone 
				worse off. List the conditions that would lead to that outcome. 
				Give an example from your business or elsewhere.<br />
				<strong>A11.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q12.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain the basic 
				tradeoff between market share and market size as it relates to 
				technology outsourcing? <strong>b.</strong> Do network effects 
				matter in this tradeoff? How? <strong>c.</strong> What part of 
				your business can you outsource safely? Will it impact your 
				market share? Will it increase the overall market size? <strong>
				d.</strong> Read the article titled “Outsourcing Complexity in 
				Smart Phones” and explain the difference between the strategies 
				of iPhone and Android phones. How is it similar to Apple vs 
				Microsoft battle in the Microcomputer market of 1980’s? How is 
				it different?<br />
