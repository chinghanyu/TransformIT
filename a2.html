				<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Create a database with one table for 
				your business. Make sure it has no unnecessary redundancy. Keep 
				your database small for demonstration purposes with just a few 
				columns and a few rows of data. Store your database in your web 
				folder. Also write a sample query relevant to your business, and 
				save it in your database. Describe your database on your a2 page 
				by using the notation TABLENAME(attribute1, attribute2, ... ), and 
				also in English. Describe your query on your a2 page by writing 
				your query in SQL, and in English.<br />
				<strong>A1.</strong> Our table in the database has the format:
				<span class="auto-style2">
				<strong>service(vendor_service, price, delivery_center, 
				service_window_hour, service_window_week)</strong></span>, which 
				is shown as follows.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" height="242" src="images/a2_ans1_table_service.png" width="557" /><br />
				Figure 1. Table: service</p>
				<p>We then made a query using following SQL command:
				<span class="auto-style2">SELECT vender_service FROM service 
				WHERE delivery_center='North Carolina';</span>. The result is 
				shown below.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" alt="" height="242" src="images/a2_ans1_table_serviceq.png" width="557" /><br />
				Figure 2. 
				Table: serviceq</p>
				<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Create a static data page containing the 
				response to your query. Save it in your folder. Create a link 
				from your a2 page to your data page.<br />
				<strong>A2.</strong> Please refer to the
				<a href="a2_ans2_table_serviceq.html" target="_blank">link</a> for our answer to
				<strong>Q2</strong>.</p>
				<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Add a second table to your database. 
				Make sure it is also non-redundant. Write a two-table query. 
				Save it in your database. Describe the new table on your a2 page 
				by using the notation of Question 1, and also in English. 
				Describe the new query on your a2 page by writing it in SQL, and 
				also in English.<br />
				<strong>A3.</strong> We first added a new table called customer 
				with format <span class="auto-style2"><strong>
				customer(vender_service, activity, reference_customer)</strong></span>.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">
				<img class="pic" height="242" src="images/a2_ans3_table_customer.png" width="557" /><br />
				Figure 3. Table: customer</p>
				<p>Then, we perfomed a two-table query using the following SQL 
				command: <span class="auto-style2">SELECT service.vender_service, service.price, 
				service.delivery_center, customer.reference_customer FROM 
				service, customer WHERE 
				service.vender_service=customer.vender_service AND 
				service.delivery_center='North Carolina' AND 
				customer.reference_customer='Cummins' AND service.price&lt;70;</span>. 
				The result is shown below.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" height="238" src="images/a2_ans3_two_table_query.png" width="553" /><br />
				Figure 4. The result of two-table query</p>
				<p><strong>Q4.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Read the article on 
				<a href="a2_direct_marketing.html" target="_blank">Direct Marketing</a> and explain how Target determines if someone is 
				pregnant. <strong>b.</strong> What is relationship marketing? 
				How is it different from direct marketing? <strong>c.</strong> 
				Why is relationship marketing more desirable than mass 
				marketing? Why was mass marketing more desirable in the past? 
				What changed? <strong>d.</strong> How can you use relationship 
				marketing in your business to improve customer service?<br />
				<strong>A4.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Direct Marketing at 
				Target is done largely through Data Processing. For every guest, 
				Target assigns a Guest ID number which stores information about 
				purchases, credit card information, and demographic data. Using 
				the stored buying data for women who registered at Target’s Baby 
				Registry, analysts were able to identify trends that indicated a 
				change in their pregnancy status. Furthermore, the analysts were 
				able to pinpoint trends in their purchases specific to which 
				trimester of their pregnancy they were in. The statisticians at 
				Target noticed that women who were pregnant bought products such 
				as unscented lotion and mineral supplements in larger 
				quantities. With the extensive analysis that he conducted, 
				statistician Andrew Pole identified 25 products. When analyzed 
				together these 25 products can be used to assign a pregnancy 
				score to each shopper and predict a due date.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> In relationship marketing, there is 
				interaction with the customer to build an individual rapport 
				with them. In this paradigm, individual customers are tracked 
				over time and treated uniquely. Maintaining such relationships 
				requires providing personalized ads, and goes so far as to 
				create personalized products. With the growth of database 
				technology, relationship marketing has become much cheaper to 
				maintain. Unlike relationship marketing where each customer is 
				uniquely tracked, direct marketing is used solely to forecast 
				customer purchases. Relationship marketing is based on trust and 
				communication with customers.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> Relationship marketing is less intrusive 
				and more personalized than mass marketing. It has many relative 
				advantages: customers get targeted information and personalized 
				services that allow them to trust the information they are 
				getting. As a result of personalized attention, relationship 
				marketing results in higher sales, as well as retention of 
				market share and dominance in certain sectors. Mass marketing 
				was more desirable in the past because it was affordable and 
				easy to implement. Newspapers, television and radios are example 
				of mass marketing. Early ads on the internet were in effect mass 
				marketing tools. With the development of database technology 
				however, acquiring and maintaining information about individual 
				customers became easier and cheaper. With time, the cost of 
				technology (database management and storage of big data) reduced 
				and tipped the scales in favor of relationship marketing.</p>
				<p><strong>d.</strong> Relationship Marketing emphasizes 
				personal relationships between the company and individual 
				customers. In return for provided unique service and 
				personalized products, the customers end up being very loyal to 
				the companies that offer them the individualized attention. 
				Because of this individualized attention, businesses that practice 
				relationship marketing often have good customer service 
				reputations. With the development of database technology, it is 
				now 5 times more expensive to obtain customers than it is to 
				maintain relationships, and personal information, about 
				individual customers. Relationship marketing can be enhanced by 
				acting on the relevant stored data for each customer.</p>
				<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Create a dynamic data page, and a link 
				to it from your main page.<br />

				<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Stock markets can be used to make 
				predictions. Go to <a href="http://www.hsx.com" target="_blank">www.hsx.com</a> 
				and see how they use a stock market to predict the success of 
				new movies. Register and buy stock in various movies. Provide a 
				screenshot of your purchases on your web page. Report on your 
				web page how the market operates and how you could use this 
				strategy in your business. Alternatively use
				<a href="http://www.hubdub.com" target="_blank">www.hubdub.com</a> to predict 
				news items, and answer the same questions.<br />

				Figure 5. 
				HSX stock market</p>
				<p>The stock market in its crude terms "Legalized Gambling". In 
				this case we start with some money (virtual H$). When I buy a 
				stock in any company (in this case movie or TV show), I invest 
				in that company and hence, if the company's value in the market 
				goes up, the price of the stock goes up and when I predict it 
				has reached saturation, its best for me to sell this share that 
				I have in the company and make the maximum profit. But, I also 
				share the risk with the company or the movie, if its not making 
				money or in the worst case starts declining in importance/sales, 
				I end up losing the amount I have in form of equities. In our 
				company, the strategy we like to use is get as many investors as 
				possible to raise more money and earn credibility in the market 
				so that even money starts pouring in and the risk is shared with 
				all the investors. Credibility is earned by acquiring more 
				reliable customers and making the our stock prices go higher. 
				The higher the credibility, the more the number of investors and 
				hence, the more I get in the future business.</p>
				<p><strong>Q8.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain how online 
				stores can take advantage of the services provided by physical 
				stores? How can physical stores respond? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Read the article titled “<a href="a2_google_vs_amazon.html" target="_blank">Google vs Amazon</a>” and explain how 
				Google intends to take advantage of the existing physical stores 
				to create an online store? <strong>c.</strong> Explain how you 
				can create synergies between physical and online stores in your 
				business, if possible. If not possible, give another example of 
				a business successfully creating synergies between online and 
				physical stores.<br />
				<strong>A8.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Online Stores (web 
				retailers) can take advantage of physical stores by offering 
				lower prices for the same product, i.e. customers can test out 
				products in a physical store but opt to buy it online for lower 
				prices. In this instance, the web retailer takes advantage of 
				physical retail spaces. Physical stores can offer personalized 
				services such as fast delivery, in store pickup (from web 
				orders), and free repairs for internet orders.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Google intends to become an intermediary 
				between local stores and customers. They are not interested in 
				building stores that offer the same service; rather they would 
				like to offer a service similar to that of amazon i.e. 
				connecting inventory (and the retailer) to the customer. Their 
				search engine will provide access to inventory, and Google will 
				take care of delivery services. Google plans on taking advantage 
				of physical inventory that they don’t have but will benefit from 
				the sales of Google Offers.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> The existence of both web and physical 
				retailers for the same business without synergy can lead to 
				cannibalization of the physical store and free rider problems. 
				To create a synergy between the web retailer and the physical 
				retailer the physical store can offer a variety of add-on 
				services that are unavailable on the internet. Physical stores 
				can be used to fill online orders and offer fast delivery 
				services. They can also be used to offer repair services for 
				items bought online. Similarly, web retailers often are able to 
				house a larger inventory for lesser costs, therefore they can be 
				used to access a larger inventory that the physical retailer may 
				not be able to offer.</p>
				<p>Example: Best Buy has a successful physical store but often 
				uses integrated services from their website in order to 
				supplement what they can offer their customers. In the event 
				that their physical store does not have a product available, 
				customers are able to order products online and have it 
				delivered to their stores for pickup.</p>
				<p><strong>Q9.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Read the 
				<a href="a2_culturomics_search_for_historical_and_cultural_trends.html" target="_blank">article on Culturomics</a> and 
				explain how Google’s Digitized Book database can be used to 
				understand historical and cultural trends. <strong>b.</strong> 
				Explain how, using the same techniques, Google’s Search data can 
				be used to make predictions about the future. <strong>c.</strong> 
				Explain how you can use such historical trends and future 
				predictions in your business strategy, with an example. <strong>
				d.</strong> Use Google Ngram Viewer to plot some historical and 
				cultural trends related to your business. For example, you can 
				plot how the relative emphasis on wireless internet and wired 
				internet changed during the last 20 years. Provide a screen shot 
				of your graph on your web page.<br />
				<strong>A9.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> In a single statement, 
				it is getting the mathematics attached to history and 
				humanities, since it’s not considered ‘measurable. ’As per the 
				article, the goal of building such a tool is to even equip the 
				kids to browse through the cultural trends throughout history, 
				as they were recorded in books. Two hundred years of history in 
				the form of 5 million digitized books can now be probed for 
				cultural trends using Google's new culturomics tool and the 
				integrated N-gram viewer.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> The kind of acceptance that is given to 
				one keyword vs. the other at a certain point of time gives an 
				idea about how popular is the topic and how many of their 
				journals or publications were popular. Seeing the trend over 200 
				years can give us an idea about whether the society has gained 
				more popularity over the other by seeing either an individual’s 
				popularity or the correlation between two authors or the topics 
				which have gained interest and this data can be used to realize 
				some amazing comparison.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> When developing a business strategy, it 
				is important to understand industry trends, the practices of 
				competitors, and the state of an existing strategy overall. For 
				example, by understanding current activity, a plan can be made 
				to accommodate market demand. It is also advisable to forecast 
				changes in order to create a system that will be able to adjust 
				to new trends. Also, it has the potential to dig out some 
				obvious errors in the past failures.</p>
				<p>Say, I have to choose between IT strategies within my firm. I 
				can look up the trends of let’s say cloud computing vs dedicated 
				infrastructure and I can make out the differences of trends as 
				shown below to get an idea. I can even go for further detailing 
				as to see what vendors or what strategies have worked out in the 
				past and what should I avoid after doing proper research.</p>

				<p><strong>Q10.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Write a negative 
				query. Save it in your database. Describe the query on your web 
				page in English and in SQL. Be careful with negative queries. If 
				it can also be written without the NOT IN feature, then it is 
				not a negative query! <strong>b.</strong> Give an example of a 
				possible database table in your business that includes an 
				unnecessary redundancy. Make sure it is not a trivial redundancy 
				that duplicates a complete row (entity) or a complete column 
				(attribute). Describe your table by using the notation TABLENAME 
				(attribute1, attribute2, …), and listing some of its contents in a 
				table format. Identify the redundancy by using specific values 
				listed in your table, and state explicitly how many times it is 
				stored. Explain how you would eliminate that redundancy. 
				Describe the new non-redundant database using the same notation 
				and show its contents using the same table format. You don’t 
				have to actually create this table in MS ACCESS.<br />
				<strong>A10.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Negative Query: Show 
				all services that are not offered in North Carolina or Mexico, 
				the SQL command is as follows: <span class="auto-style2">SELECT 
				distinct customer.vender_service FROM customer, service WHERE 
				(customer.vender_service NOT IN (SELECT service.vender_service 
				FROM service WHERE service.delivery_center='North Carolina' OR 
				service.delivery_center='Mexico'));</span></p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Redundant Database:&nbsp; <span class="auto-style2"><strong>
				total_revenue(reference_customer, delivery_ceneter, 
				gross_revenue, YTD)</strong></span></p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" height="242" src="images/a2_ans10_redundant_database.png" width="557" /><br />
				Firuge 8. A table with redundancy</p>
				<p> In this database we are interested in knowing the gross 
				revenue per customer for each service that we offer. It is 
				redundant, because while it is helpful to know the gross revenue 
				per customer for every delivery center, the delivery center 
				field is stored twice in two different tables. It is unecessary 
				to have the the delivery center field in this table because two 
				nested queries can help extract the delivery center data from 
				the first two tables using the common key:
				<span class="auto-style2"><strong>vender_service</strong></span>. 
				Therefore, we can have our inredundant table with the following format:
				<span class="auto-style2"><strong>
				total_revenue(reference_customer, gross_revenue, YTD)</strong></span>.</p>
				<p><strong>Q11.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain the 
				fundamental tradeoff between inconsistency and information 
				overload in organizational decision-making. How is it related to 
				the centralization-decentralization debate? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Can organizational databases improve centralized decision 
				making? How? <strong>c.</strong> Do network effects tip the 
				balance towards centralization or decentralization according to 
				Braess’ Paradox? <strong>d.</strong> Braess uses highways to 
				demonstrate his paradox. Do highways have network effects? What 
				kind? <strong>e.</strong> Braess argues that wide spread 
				adoption of new and improved technologies may leave everyone 
				worse off. List the conditions that would lead to that outcome. 
				Give an example from your business or elsewhere.<br />
				<strong>A11.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Inconsistency vs. overload is one of the primary trade-offs, which originated the 
				centralization-decentralization debate. When the data is 
				inconsistent, this means the data is not collected and 
				synchronized in some cases to other units of the same business 
				(also referred as localized data). In this case there is not 
				enough data to make interpretation or the decision making is 
				done locally at every unit. On the other hand, when there is a 
				lot of data to analyze at a central level, it could lead to 
				discrepancies among various units since all the policies are 
				centralized. It makes the system more complex and has a single 
				point of failure.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Yes, the organizational databases improve 
				centralized decision making since, everyone has the same 
				consistent information to analyze and in turn the decision 
				makers in an organization use that centralized database to 
				create new policies and business strategies moving forward. This 
				also leads to consistency among the data in different business 
				units and can lead to an integrated environment.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> According to the Braess’ paradox, network 
				effects tip the scale towards centralization as the network 
				effects always start from the center and the center is the 
				originating point.</p>
				<p><strong>d.</strong> Braess paradox uses highways to show the 
				fact that adding an extra road or increasing capacity in a 
				traffic network can actually increase the average travel time on 
				a highway. A good example of this was seen in Boston’s Big dig 
				project. According to boston.com: The Big Dig, essentially 
				increased the capacity of the central highway and its 
				interchanges by placing the entire system as a series of tunnels 
				under the central business district. It did relieve congestion 
				but the overall commute times were actually longer as a result. 
				As almost all people started using the new route, which led to a 
				bottleneck on that route. This was the cause of network effects.</p>
				<p><strong>e.</strong> According to Braess, the wide spread 
				adoption of new technologies may leave everyone worse-off. The 
				condition on this statement is that without adequate 
				centralization, we won’t be able to realize proper network 
				effects. For example, If we upgrade only a part of our business 
				to enjoy greater bandwidth due to the load on that unit. But, if 
				we don’t implement it centrally, we risk forming a bottleneck in 
				the routes between these units. This could lead to what Braess 
				tried to explain.</p>
				<p><strong>Q12.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain the basic 
				tradeoff between market share and market size as it relates to 
				technology outsourcing? <strong>b.</strong> Do network effects 
				matter in this tradeoff? How? <strong>c.</strong> What part of 
				your business can you outsource safely? Will it impact your 
				market share? Will it increase the overall market size? <strong>
				d.</strong> Read the article titled “<a href="a2_outsourcing_complexity_in_smart_phones.html" target="_blank">Outsourcing Complexity in 
				Smart Phones</a>” and explain the difference between the strategies 
				of iPhone and Android phones. How is it similar to Apple vs 
				Microsoft battle in the Microcomputer market of 1980’s? How is 
				it different?<br />
				<strong>A12.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> When Technology is 
				outsourced by a company, for example Microsoft’s outsourcing of 
				hardware and property over software, they sacrifice a large 
				market share of a small market size in favor of a small market 
				share of large market size. Outsourcing a portion of technology 
				increases the size of the market, i.e. there is a higher and 
				more varied supply for the same market. As a result each 
				provider has a control over a smaller portion of the market.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Outsourcing technology increases the size 
				of the market and reduces costs and prices leading to a larger 
				market size. When you have a larger market, network effects can 
				be instrumental in popularizing the product. In the example 
				mentioned above, lower costs of Microsoft computers leads to 
				more people buying them; with more users, one expects that 
				application development for this platform will grow. As the 
				number of available applications grows, it attracts more users, 
				increasing the size of the market even more. As you can see, 
				network effects can be instrumental in the trade-off related to 
				outsourcing technology.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> When outsourcing a portion of your 
				business, it is advisable that core competence isn’t 
				compromised. A company’s core competence is the portion of their 
				services which gives them an edge over other companies that 
				offer the same services. Outsourcing the non-complex part of 
				your business is advisable since it will increase your market 
				size while reducing the market share. However, the service your 
				business provides is likely to gain monetary advantage due to 
				the network effects that technological outsourcing leads to.</p>
				<p><strong>d.</strong> Similarities: The iPhone is once again 
				maintaining a tight control over their technology, whereas 
				Android, like Microsoft in the past, has outsourced the hardware 
				platform and kept the Android OS as their core competence. 
				Because of this tight hold on their technology, both hardware 
				and software, Apple is sacrificing the lead that they had over 
				the first few years of debuting the iPhone. Also, despite having 
				better and more applications available on the App Store, with 
				time the android app store could grow to be just as profitable, 
				or more so than the Apple app store.</p>
				<p>Differences: Contrary to the first conflict (against 
				Microsoft), the iPhone has the advantage of two other devices on 
				the market: the iPod Touch and the iPad. Since all three run 
				iOS, they can take advantage of one iTunes user account, in 
				essence, rather than competing with one device, Apple is 
				fighting in 3 markets (mp3 players, smartphones, tablets) with 
				one OS which is giving them a larger market share than before.</p>
				<p>In any case, the difference in Strategy is affording Apple 
				only a slight advantage in terms of market share. Monetarily 
				however, this advantage gives them a significant amount of 
				capital which they invest in maintaining their competitive 
				advantage.</p>
