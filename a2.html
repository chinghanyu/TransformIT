				<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Create a database with one table for 
				your business. Make sure it has no unnecessary redundancy. Keep 
				your database small for demonstration purposes with just a few 
				columns and a few rows of data. Store your database in your web 
				folder. Also write a sample query relevant to your business, and 
				save it in your database. Describe your database on your a2 page 
				by using the notation TABLENAME(attribute1, attribute2, ... ), and 
				also in English. Describe your query on your a2 page by writing 
				your query in SQL, and in English.<br />
				<strong>A1.</strong> Our table in the database has the format:
				<span class="auto-style2">
				<strong>service(vendor_service, price, delivery_center, 
				service_window_hour, service_window_week)</strong></span>, which 
				is shown as follows.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" height="242" src="images/a2_ans1_table_service.png" width="557" /><br />
				Figure 1. Table: service</p>
				<p>We then made a query using following SQL command:
				<span class="auto-style2">SELECT vender_service FROM service 
				WHERE delivery_center='North Carolina';</span>. The result is 
				shown below.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" alt="" height="242" src="images/a2_ans1_table_serviceq.png" width="557" /><br />
				Figure 2. 
				Table: serviceq</p>
				<p><strong>Q2.</strong> Create a static data page containing the 
				response to your query. Save it in your folder. Create a link 
				from your a2 page to your data page.<br />
				<strong>A2.</strong> Please refer to the
				<a href="a2_ans2_table_serviceq.html">link</a> for our answer to
				<strong>Q2</strong>.</p>
				<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Add a second table to your database. 
				Make sure it is also non-redundant. Write a two-table query. 
				Save it in your database. Describe the new table on your a2 page 
				by using the notation of Question 1, and also in English. 
				Describe the new query on your a2 page by writing it in SQL, and 
				also in English.<br />
				<strong>A3.</strong> We first added a new table called customer 
				with format <span class="auto-style2"><strong>
				customer(vender_service, activity, reference_customer)</strong></span>.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1">
				<img class="pic" height="242" src="images/a2_ans3_table_customer.png" width="557" /><br />
				Figure 3. Table: customer</p>
				<p>Then, we perfomed a two-table query using the following SQL 
				command: <span class="auto-style2">SELECT service.vender_service, service.price, 
				service.delivery_center, customer.reference_customer FROM 
				service, customer WHERE 
				service.vender_service=customer.vender_service AND 
				service.delivery_center='North Carolina' AND 
				customer.reference_customer='Cummins' AND service.price&lt;70;</span>. 
				The result is shown below.</p>
				<p class="auto-style1"><img class="pic" height="238" src="images/a2_ans3_two_table_query.png" width="553" /><br />

				<p><strong>Q4.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Read the article on 
				<a href="a2_direct_marketing.html" target="_blank">Direct Marketing</a> and explain how Target determines if someone is 
				pregnant. <strong>b.</strong> What is relationship marketing? 
				How is it different from direct marketing? <strong>c.</strong> 
				Why is relationship marketing more desirable than mass 
				marketing? Why was mass marketing more desirable in the past? 
				What changed? <strong>d.</strong> How can you use relationship 
				marketing in your business to improve customer service?<br />
				<strong>A4. </strong>Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Create a dynamic data page, and a link 
				to it from your main page.<br />
				<strong>A5.</strong> Please refer to the 
				<a href="a2_ans5_serviced.aspx">link</a> for our answer to
				<strong>Q5</strong>. The SQL 
				command used to query was the same as that in <strong>A1</strong>.</p>
				<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Create an interactive data page, and a 
				link to it from your main page.<br />
				<strong>A6.</strong> Please refer to the
				<a href="a2_ans_servicei.aspx">
				link</a> for our answer to <strong>Q6</strong>.</p>
				<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Stock markets can be used to make 
				predictions. Go to <a href="http://www.hsx.com" target="_blank">www.hsx.com</a> 
				and see how they use a stock market to predict the success of 
				new movies. Register and buy stock in various movies. Provide a 
				screenshot of your purchases on your web page. Report on your 
				web page how the market operates and how you could use this 
				strategy in your business. Alternatively use
				<a href="http://www.hubdub.com" target="_blank">www.hubdub.com</a> to predict 
				news items, and answer the same questions.<br />

				<p><strong>Q8.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain how online 
				stores can take advantage of the services provided by physical 
				stores? How can physical stores respond? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Read the article titled “<a href="a2_google_vs_amazon.html" target="_blank">Google vs Amazon</a>” and explain how 
				Google intends to take advantage of the existing physical stores 
				to create an online store? <strong>c.</strong> Explain how you 
				can create synergies between physical and online stores in your 
				business, if possible. If not possible, give another example of 
				a business successfully creating synergies between online and 
				physical stores.<br />
				<strong>A8.</strong> Answer begins here.</p>
				<p><strong>Q9.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Read the 
				<a href="a2_culturomics_search_for_historical_and_cultural_trends.html" target="_blank">article on Culturomics</a> and 
				explain how Google’s Digitized Book database can be used to 
				understand historical and cultural trends. <strong>b.</strong> 
				Explain how, using the same techniques, Google’s Search data can 
				be used to make predictions about the future. <strong>c.</strong> 
				Explain how you can use such historical trends and future 
				predictions in your business strategy, with an example. <strong>
				d.</strong> Use Google Ngram Viewer to plot some historical and 
				cultural trends related to your business. For example, you can 
				plot how the relative emphasis on wireless internet and wired 
				internet changed during the last 20 years. Provide a screen shot 
				of your graph on your web page.<br />
				<strong>A9.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> In a single statement, 
				it is getting the mathematics attached to history and 
				humanities, since it’s not considered ‘measurable. ’As per the 
				article, the goal of building such a tool is to even equip the 
				kids to browse through the cultural trends throughout history, 
				as they were recorded in books. Two hundred years of history in 
				the form of 5 million digitized books can now be probed for 
				cultural trends using Google's new culturomics tool and the 
				integrated N-gram viewer.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> The kind of acceptance that is given to 
				one keyword vs. the other at a certain point of time gives an 
				idea about how popular is the topic and how many of their 
				journals/publications were popular. Seeing the trend over 200 
				years can give us an idea about whether the society has gained 
				more popularity over the other by seeing either an individual’s 
				popularity or the correlation between two authors/the topics 
				which have gained interest and this data can be used to realize 
				some amazing.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> When developing a business strategy, it 
				is important to understand industry trends, the practices of 
				competitors, and the state of an existing strategy overall. For 
				example, by understanding current activity, a plan can be made 
				to accommodate market demand. It is also advisable to forecast 
				changes in order to create a system that will be able to adjust 
				to new trends. Also, it has the potential to dig out some 
				obvious errors in the past failures.</p>
				<p>Say, I have to choose between IT strategies within my firm. I 
				can look up the trends of let’s say cloud computing vs dedicated 
				infrastructure and I can make out the differences of trends as 
				shown below to get an idea. I can even go for further detailing 
				as to see what vendors or what strategies have worked out in the 
				past and what should I avoid after doing proper research.</p>

				<p><strong>Q10.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Write a negative 
				query. Save it in your database. Describe the query on your web 
				page in English and in SQL. Be careful with negative queries. If 
				it can also be written without the NOT IN feature, then it is 
				not a negative query! <strong>b.</strong> Give an example of a 
				possible database table in your business that includes an 
				unnecessary redundancy. Make sure it is not a trivial redundancy 
				that duplicates a complete row (entity) or a complete column 
				(attribute). Describe your table by using the notation TABLENAME 
				(attribute1, attribute2, …), and listing some of its contents in a 
				table format. Identify the redundancy by using specific values 
				listed in your table, and state explicitly how many times it is 
				stored. Explain how you would eliminate that redundancy. 
				Describe the new non-redundant database using the same notation 
				and show its contents using the same table format. You don’t 
				have to actually create this table in MS ACCESS.<br />

				<p><strong>Q11.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain the 
				fundamental tradeoff between inconsistency and information 
				overload in organizational decision-making. How is it related to 
				the centralization-decentralization debate? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Can organizational databases improve centralized decision 
				making? How? <strong>c.</strong> Do network effects tip the 
				balance towards centralization or decentralization according to 
				Braess’ Paradox? <strong>d.</strong> Braess uses highways to 
				demonstrate his paradox. Do highways have network effects? What 
				kind? <strong>e.</strong> Braess argues that wide spread 
				adoption of new and improved technologies may leave everyone 
				worse off. List the conditions that would lead to that outcome. 
				Give an example from your business or elsewhere.<br />
				<strong>A11.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Inconsistency vs 
				Overload is one of the primary trade-offs, which originated the 
				centralization-decentralization debate. When the data is 
				inconsistent, this means the data is not collected and 
				synchronized in some cases to other units of the same business 
				(also referred as localized data). In this case there is not 
				enough data to make interpretation or the decision making is 
				done locally at every unit. On the other hand, when there is a 
				lot of data to analyze at a central level, it could lead to 
				discrepancies among various units since all the policies are 
				centralized. It makes the system more complex and has a single 
				point of failure.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Yes, the organizational databases improve 
				centralized decision making since, everyone has the same 
				consistent information to analyze and in turn the decision 
				makers in an organization use that centralized database to 
				create new policies and business strategies moving forward. This 
				also leads to consistency among the data in different business 
				units and can lead to an integrated environment.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> According to the Braess’ paradox, network 
				effects tip the scale towards centralization as the network 
				effects always start from the center and the center is the 
				originating point.</p>
				<p><strong>d.</strong> Braess paradox uses highways to show the 
				fact that adding an extra road or increasing capacity in a 
				traffic network can actually increase the average travel time on 
				a highway. A good example of this was seen in Boston’s Big dig 
				project. According to boston.com: The Big Dig, essentially 
				increased the capacity of the central highway and its 
				interchanges by placing the entire system as a series of tunnels 
				under the central business district. It did relieve congestion 
				but the overall commute times were actually longer as a result. 
				As almost all people started using the new route, which led to a 
				bottleneck on that route. This was the cause of Network Effects.</p>
				<p><strong>e.</strong> According to Braess, the wide spread 
				adoption of new technologies may leave everyone worse-off. The 
				condition on this statement is that without adequate 
				centralization, we won’t be able to realize proper Network 
				effects. For example, If we upgrade only a part of our business 
				to enjoy greater bandwidth due to the load on that unit. But, if 
				we don’t implement it centrally, we risk forming a bottleneck in 
				the routes between these units. This could lead to what Braess 
				tried to explain.</p>
				<p><strong>Q12.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Explain the basic 
				tradeoff between market share and market size as it relates to 
				technology outsourcing? <strong>b.</strong> Do network effects 
				matter in this tradeoff? How? <strong>c.</strong> What part of 
				your business can you outsource safely? Will it impact your 
				market share? Will it increase the overall market size? <strong>
				d.</strong> Read the article titled “Outsourcing Complexity in 
				Smart Phones” and explain the difference between the strategies 
				of iPhone and Android phones. How is it similar to Apple vs 
				Microsoft battle in the Microcomputer market of 1980’s? How is 
				it different?<br />
