				<h3>With Google Now, Android Puts Apple's Siri To Shame</h3>
				<p>Business Insider July 1, 2012 Steve Kovach</p>
				<p>After Apple bought Siri a few years ago, many assumed it was 
				the company's first step in a battle against Google's search 
				business. It was a good assumption.</p>
				<p>But at All Things D's D8 conference in 2010, Steve Jobs tried 
				to put that speculation to rest by saying Apple had slightly 
				different plans for Siri.</p>
				<p>"[It's] not a search company. They're an AI company. We have 
				no plans to go into the search business. We don't care about it. 
				Other people do it well," Jobs told Kara Swisher and Walt 
				Mossberg.</p>
				<p>Jobs was mostly right. Siri launched on the iPhone 4S in 
				October as more of an intelligent virtual assistant than a 
				searching tool. Siri is designed to set reminders, send 
				text messages, make appointments, etc. Search is kind of part of 
				Siri, but it relies heavily on Wolfram Alpha, a "knowledge 
				engine" that usually does a great job at answering oddball 
				questions like "What's the GDP of Greece?" but not so great at 
				pulling up queries normal humans need.</p>
				<p>That's why I was so excited when Google announced Google Now, 
				a search-centric, voice-powered digital assistant for the 
				upcoming version of Android called Jelly Bean.</p>
				<p>I've been using Jelly Bean on a Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 for 
				the last few days. And I can say Google Now is a lot more 
				impressive than Siri. Google Now fills in all the gaps left by 
				Siri, and does pretty much everything else a whole lot better. 
				This is how search should work on mobile devices.</p>
				<p>A few examples:</p>
				<p>&bull; I was in San Francisco last week to cover Google I/O 
				and meet with some other companies in the area. I had a meeting 
				in Mountain View on Friday morning. Google Now sent me a 
				notification about 45 minutes before my meeting that said I 
				should leave if I wanted to make it on time. It even took 
				traffic into account. Incredible.</p>
				<p>&bull; The other night I was getting dinner with a few old 
				journalism friends from college. We were talking about Jim 
				Romenesko, and one of my friends wondered how old he was. I 
				asked Google Now, "How old is Jim Romenesko?" The answer came up 
				in less than a second.</p>
				<p>&bull; I'm a Mets fan (unfortunately), so a lot of my 
				sports-related Google searches are for the score of the latest 
				game. Google knows this, so Google Now automatically sends me 
				notifications with the latest score. I don't even have to ask 
				anymore.</p>
				<p>&bull; I took the red eye back to New York Friday night, 
				and spent the hours before my flight 
				drinking with some PR friends in San Francisco's Mission 
				neighborhood. Based on my search history, Google Now already 
				knew my flight number and kept me updated with gate information 
				and potential delays.</p>
				<p>And Google Now is fast. I spoke with Hugo Barra, Google's 
				Android product boss, the other day, and he told me the Google 
				Now team spent months shaving seconds off the response time. It 
				shows. Not only is Google Now better than Siri at pulling up 
				relevant information, but it's also nearly instantaneous.</p>
				<p>Compare that speed to Siri. Depending on how well Apple's 
				servers are doing on a given day, it can take several painful 
				seconds for Siri to pull up an answer.</p>
				<p>Google Now is exactly what I want in a virtual assistant. I 
				don't need cutesy jokes and quips about which smartphone is the 
				best. I need answers. And Google Now provides me with the 
				answers I want. The end. (Sometimes I don't even have to ask. 
				Google Now just knows what I need. Incredible.)</p>
				<p>Now before all the Apple fans start skewering me in the 
				comments, a few points:</p>
				<p>&bull; Yes, I understand Siri is still in beta. But the truth 
				of the matter is Apple doesn't promote it as a beta product. 
				It's the flagship feature of its top-of-the-line iPhone 4S. Just 
				look at all those celebrity-packed commercials. It doesn't come 
				off as a beta product, does it?</p>
				<p>&bull; I also understand Siri will get a lot better with the 
				launch of iOS 6, Apple's new mobile operating system, this 
				fall. Siri will be able to give you sports scores, movie times, 
				restaurant reviews, and more.</p>
				<p>&bull; As I've been testing Google Now, I posted a few tweets 
				about my experience. The response from Apple fans has mostly 
				been "Yeah, well, Siri has personality! And people like that!" 
				I'm guessing they're talking about Siri's ability to tell jokes 
				and provide some witty back talk. Yes, that's pretty cool, and 
				I'm sure Siri users get a big old kick out of it, but it's not 
				useful.</p>
				<p>As good as Google Now is, there's a huge, gaping problem. As 
				I've written a million times before, Google and its hardware and 
				carrier partners are notoriously awful at providing timely 
				updates for Android devices. Jelly Bean launches in mid July, 
				yet only about 7% of devices are running Ice Cream Sandwich, the 
				current version of Android that launched about seven months ago. 
				Almost everyone else is running Gingerbread, a version of 
				Android that launched in late 2010.</p>
				<p>At this rate, it'll be at least another year before most 
				Android users get to take advantage of Google Now. Meanwhile 
				Apple continues to sell tens of millions of Siri-powered iPhone 
				4Ss per quarter. Even though I think Siri is an inferior 
				product, more people are going to be using it. And that gives 
				Apple a huge advantage over Google. </p>
				<p>And that stinks. iPhone users have no idea what they're 
				missing. Android users probably won't get to try Google Now 
				until they buy a new phone that comes pre-loaded with Jelly 
				Bean. </p>
				<p>I have no doubt that Apple will add better search features to 
				Siri over time. But what most people won't realize is that 
				Google has already beaten Siri with Google Now.</p>
