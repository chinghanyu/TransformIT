				<h3>The Dirty Little Secrets of Search</h3>
				<h4>PRETEND for a moment that you are Google’s search engine.</h4>
				<p>NY Times February 12, 2011 <br />
				By DAVID SEGAL</p>
				<p>Someone types the word “dresses” and hits enter. What will be 
				the very first result?</p>
				<p>There are, of course, a lot of possibilities. Macy’s comes to 
				mind. Maybe a specialty chain, like J. Crew or the Gap. Perhaps 
				a Wikipedia entry on the history of hemlines.</p>
				<p>O.K., how about the word “bedding”? Bed Bath &amp; Beyond seems a 
				candidate. Or Wal-Mart, or perhaps the bedding section of 
				Amazon.com.</p>
				<p>“Area rugs”? Crate &amp; Barrel is a possibility. Home Depot, 
				too, and Sears, Pier 1 or any of those Web sites with “area rug” 
				in the name, like arearugs.com.</p>
				<p>You could imagine a dozen contenders for each of these 
				searches. But in the last several months, one name turned up, 
				with uncanny regularity, in the No. 1 spot for each and every 
				term:</p>
				<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/penney_j_c_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org" target="_blank">J. C. Penney</a></p>
				<p>The company bested millions of sites — and not just in 
				searches for dresses, bedding and area rugs. For months, it was 
				consistently at or near the top in searches for “skinny jeans,” 
				“home decor,” “comforter sets,” “furniture” and dozens of other 
				words and phrases, from the blandly generic (“tablecloths”) to 
				the strangely specific (“grommet top curtains”).</p>
				<p>This striking performance lasted for months, most crucially 
				through the holiday season, when there is a huge spike in online 
				shopping. J. C. Penney even beat out the sites of manufacturers 
				in searches for the products of those manufacturers. Type in 
				“Samsonite carry on luggage,” for instance, and Penney for 
				months was first on the list, ahead of Samsonite.com.</p>
				<p>With more than 1,100 stores and $17.8 billion in total revenue 
				in 2010, Penney is certainly a major player in American 
				retailing. But Google’s stated goal is to sift through every 
				corner of the Internet and find the most important, relevant Web 
				sites.</p>
				<p>Does the collective wisdom of the Web really say that Penney has 
				the most essential site when it comes to dresses? And bedding? 
				And area rugs? And dozens of other words and phrases?</p>
				<p>The New York Times asked an expert in online search, Doug Pierce 
				of Blue Fountain Media in New York, to study this question, as 
				well as Penney’s astoundingly strong search-term performance in 
				recent months. What he found suggests that the digital age’s 
				most mundane act, the Google search, often represents layer upon 
				layer of intrigue. And the intrigue starts in the sprawling, 
				subterranean world of “black hat” optimization, the dark art of 
				raising the profile of a Web site with methods that Google 
				considers tantamount to cheating.</p>
				<p>Despite the cowboy outlaw connotations, black-hat services are 
				not illegal, but trafficking in them risks the wrath of Google. 
				The company draws a pretty thick line between techniques it 
				considers deceptive and “white hat” approaches, which are 
				offered by hundreds of consulting firms and are legitimate ways 
				to increase a site’s visibility. Penney’s results were derived 
				from methods on the wrong side of that line, says Mr. Pierce. He 
				described the optimization as the most ambitious attempt to game 
				Google’s search results that he has ever seen.</p>
				<p>“Actually, it’s the most ambitious attempt I’ve ever heard of,” 
				he said. “This whole thing just blew me away. Especially for 
				such a major brand. You’d think they would have people around 
				them that would know better.”</p>
				<p>TO understand the strategy that kept J. C. Penney in the pole 
				position for so many searches, you need to know how Web sites 
				rise to the top of Google’s results. We’re talking, to be clear, 
				about the “organic” results — in other words, the ones that are 
				not paid advertisements. In deriving organic results, Google’s 
				algorithm takes into account dozens of criteria, many of which 
				the company will not discuss.</p>
				<p>But it has described one crucial factor in detail: links from 
				one site to another.</p>
				<p>If you own a Web site, for instance, about Chinese cooking, your 
				site’s Google ranking will improve as other sites link to it. 
				The more links to your site, especially those from other Chinese 
				cooking-related sites, the higher your ranking. In a way, what 
				Google is measuring is your site’s popularity by polling the 
				best-informed online fans of Chinese cooking and counting their 
				links to your site as votes of approval.</p>
				<p>But even links that have nothing to do with Chinese cooking can 
				bolster your profile if your site is barnacled with enough of 
				them. And here’s where the strategy that aided Penney comes in. 
				Someone paid to have thousands of links placed on hundreds of 
				sites scattered around the Web, all of which lead directly to 
				JCPenney.com.</p>
				<p>Who is that someone? A spokeswoman for J. C. Penney, Darcie 
				Brossart, says it was not Penney.</p>
				<p>“J. C. Penney did not authorize, and we were not involved with 
				or aware of, the posting of the links that you sent to us, as it 
				is against our natural search policies,” Ms. Brossart wrote in 
				an e-mail. She added, “We are working to have the links taken 
				down.”</p>
				<p>The links do not bear any fingerprints, but nothing else about 
				them was particularly subtle. Using an online tool called Open 
				Site Explorer, Mr. Pierce found 2,015 pages with phrases like 
				“casual dresses,” “evening dresses,” “little black dress” or 
				“cocktail dress.” Click on any of these phrases on any of these 
				2,015 pages, and you are bounced directly to the main page for 
				dresses on JCPenney.com.</p>
				<p>Some of the 2,015 pages are on sites related, at least 
				nominally, to clothing. But most are not. The phrase “black 
				dresses” and a Penney link were tacked to the bottom of a site 
				called nuclear.engineeringaddict.com. “Evening dresses” appeared 
				on a site called casino-focus.com. “Cocktail dresses” showed up 
				on bulgariapropertyportal.com. ”Casual dresses” was on a site 
				called elistofbanks.com. “Semi-formal dresses” was pasted, 
				rather incongruously, on usclettermen.org.</p>
				<p>There are links to JCPenney.com’s dresses page on sites about 
				diseases, cameras, cars, dogs, aluminum sheets, travel, snoring, 
				diamond drills, bathroom tiles, hotel furniture, online games, 
				commodities, fishing, Adobe Flash, glass shower doors, jokes and 
				dentists — and the list goes on.</p>
				<p>Some of these sites seem all but abandoned, except for the 
				links. The greeting at myflhomebuyer.com sounds like the saddest 
				fortune cookie ever: “Sorry, but you are looking for something 
				that isn’t here.”</p>
				<p>When you read the enormous list of sites with Penney links, the 
				landscape of the Internet acquires a whole new topography. It 
				starts to seem like a city with a few familiar, well-kept 
				buildings, surrounded by millions of hovels kept upright for no 
				purpose other than the ads that are painted on their walls.</p>
				<p>Exploiting those hovels for links is a Google no-no. The 
				company’s guidelines warn against using tricks to improve search 
				engine rankings, including what it refers to as “link schemes.” 
				The penalty for getting caught is a pair of virtual concrete 
				shoes: the company sinks in Google’s results.</p>
				<p>Often drastically. In 2006, Google announced that it had caught 
				BMW using a black-hat strategy to bolster the company’s German 
				Web site, BMW.de. That site was temporarily given what the BBC 
				at the time called “the death penalty,” stating that it was 
				“removed from search results.”</p>
				<p>BMW acknowledged that it had set up “doorway pages,” which exist 
				just to attract search engines and then redirect traffic to a 
				different site. The company at the time said it had no intention 
				of deceiving users, adding “if Google says all doorway pages are 
				illegal, we have to take this into consideration.”</p>
				<p>J. C. Penney, it seems, will not suffer the same fate. But 
				starting Wednesday, it was the subject of what Google calls 
				“corrective action.”</p>
				<p>Last week, The Times sent Google the evidence it had collected 
				about the links to JCPenney.com. Google promptly set up an 
				interview with Matt Cutts, the head of the Webspam team at 
				Google, and a man whose every speech, blog post and Twitter 
				update is parsed like papal encyclicals by players in the search 
				engine world.</p>
				<p>“I can confirm that this violates our guidelines,” said Mr. 
				Cutts during an hourlong interview on Wednesday, after looking 
				at a list of paid links to JCPenney.com.</p>
				<p>He said Google had detected previous guidelines violations 
				related to JCPenney.com on three occasions, most recently last 
				November. Each time, steps were taken that reduced Penney’s 
				search results — Mr. Cutts avoids the word “punished” — but 
				Google did not later “circle back” to the company to see if it 
				was still breaking the rules, he said.</p>
				<p>He and his team had missed this recent campaign of paid links, 
				which he said had been up and running for the last three to four 
				months.</p>
				<p>“Do I wish our system had detected things sooner? I do,” he 
				said. “But given the one billion queries that Google handles 
				each day, I think we do an amazing job.”</p>
				<p>Mr. Cutts sounded remarkably upbeat and unperturbed during this 
				conversation, which was a surprise given that we were discussing 
				a large, sustained effort to snooker his employer. Asked about 
				his zenlike calm, he said the company strives not to act out of 
				anger. You get the sense that Mr. Cutts and his colleagues are 
				acutely aware of the singular power they wield as judge, jury 
				and appeals panel, and they’re eager to project an air of 
				maturity and judiciousness.</p>
				<p>That said, he added, “I don’t think I could do my job well if in 
				some sense I was not offended by things that were bad for Google 
				users.”</p>
				<p>“Am I happy this happened?” he later asked. “Absolutely not. Is 
				Google going to take strong corrective action? We absolutely 
				will.”</p>
				<p>And the company did. On Wednesday evening, Google began what it 
				calls a “manual action” against Penney, essentially demotions 
				specifically aimed at the company.</p>
				<p>At 7 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, J. C. Penney was still the 
				No. 1 result for “Samsonite carry on luggage.”</p>
				<p>Two hours later, it was at No. 71.</p>
				<p>At 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Penney was No. 1 in searches for “living 
				room furniture.”</p>
				<p>By 9 p.m., it had sunk to No. 68.</p>
				<p>In other words, one moment Penney was the most visible online 
				destination for living room furniture in the country.</p>
				<p>The next it was essentially buried.</p>
				<p>PENNEY reacted to this instant reversal of fortune by, among 
				other things, firing its search engine consulting firm, 
				SearchDex. Executives there did not return e-mail or phone 
				calls.</p>
				<p>Penney also issued a statement: “We are disappointed that Google 
				has reduced our rankings due to this matter,” Ms. Brossart 
				wrote, “but we will continue to work actively to retain our high 
				natural search position.”</p>
				<p>She added that while the collection of links surely brought in 
				additional revenue, it was hardly a bonanza. Just 7 percent of 
				JCPenney.com’s traffic comes from clicks on organic search 
				results, she wrote. A far bigger source of profits this holiday 
				season, she stated, came from partnerships with companies like 
				Yahoo and Time Warner, from new mobile applications and from 
				in-store kiosks.</p>
				<p>Search experts, however, say Penney likely reaped substantial 
				rewards from the paid links. If you think of Google as the 
				entrance to the planet’s largest shopping center, the links 
				helped Penney appear as though it was the first and most 
				inviting spot in the mall, to millions and millions of online 
				shoppers.</p>
				<p>How valuable was that? A study last May by Daniel Ruby of 
				Chitika, an online advertising network of 100,000 sites, found 
				that, on average, 34 percent of Google’s traffic went to the No. 
				1 result, about twice the percentage that went to No. 2.</p>
				<p>The Keyword Estimator at Google puts the number of searches for 
				“dresses” in the United States at 11.1 million a month, an 
				average based on 12 months of data. So for “dresses” alone, 
				Penney may have been attracting roughly 3.8 million visits every 
				month it showed up as No. 1. Exactly how many of those visits 
				translate into sales, and the size of each sale, only Penney 
				would know.</p>
				<p>But in January, the company was crowing about its online holiday 
				sales. Kate Coultas, a company spokeswoman, wrote to a reporter 
				in January, “Internet sales through jcp.com posted strong growth 
				in December, with significant increases in traffic and orders 
				for the key holiday shopping periods of the week after 
				Thanksgiving and the week before Christmas.”</p>
				<p>There was considerable pressure from investors for Penney to 
				deliver strong holiday results. It has been struggling through 
				one of the more trying times of its century of retailing. The 
				$17.8 billion in revenue it reported last year is the exact same 
				figure it reported in 2001. It announced in January that it 
				would close a handful of underperforming stores, as well as two 
				of its five call centers and 19 outlets that sell excess catalog 
				merchandise.</p>
				<p>Adding to the company’s woes is the demise of its catalog 
				business. Penney has phased out what it called its Big Book and 
				poured money into its Web site. But so far, the loss of the 
				catalog has not been offset by the expansion of the Web site. At 
				its peak, the catalog brought in about $4 billion in revenue. In 
				2009, the site brought in $1.5 billion.</p>
				<p>“For the last 35 years, Penney has tried to be accepted as a 
				department store, and during unusually good times, it does very 
				well,” said Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Gilford Securities. 
				“But in bad times, it gets punished by shoppers who pull back 
				after having spent aspirationally.”</p>
				<p>MANY owners of Web sites with Penney links seem to relish their 
				unreachability. But there were exceptions, and they included 
				cocaman.ch. (“Geekness — closer to the world” is the cryptic 
				header atop the site.) It turned out to be owned and run by 
				Corsin Camichel, a chatty 25-year-old I.T. security analyst in 
				Switzerland.</p>
				<p>The word “dresses” appears in a small collection of links in the 
				middle of a largely blank Cocaman page. Asked about that link, 
				Mr. Camichel said his records show that it turned up on his site 
				last April, though he said it might have been earlier than that.</p>
				<p>The link came through a Web site, TNX.net, which pays Mr. 
				Camichel with TNX points, which he then trades for links that 
				drive traffic to his other sites, like cookingutensils.net. He 
				earns money when people visit that site and click on the ads. He 
				could also, he said, get cash from TNX. Currently, Cocaman is 
				home to 403 links, all of them placed there by TNX on behalf of 
				clients.</p>
				<p>“You do pretty well,” he wrote, referring to income from his 
				links trading. “The thing is, the more you invest (time and 
				money) the better results you get. Right now I get enough to buy 
				myself new test devices for my Android apps (like $150/month) 
				with zero effort. I have to do nothing. Ads just sit there and 
				if people click, I make money.”</p>
				<p>Efforts to reach TNX itself last week via e-mail were not 
				successful.</p>
				<p>Interviewing a purveyor of black-hat services face-to-face was a 
				considerable undertaking. They are a low-profile bunch. But a 
				link-selling specialist named Mark Stevens — who says he had 
				nothing to do with the Penney link effort — agreed to chat. He 
				did so on the condition that his company not be named, a 
				precaution he justified by recounting what happened when the 
				company apparently angered Google a few months ago.</p>
				<p>“It was my fault,” Mr. Stevens said. “I posted a job opening on 
				a Stanford Engineering alumni mailing list, and mentioned the 
				name of our company and a brief description of what we do. I 
				think some Google employees saw it.”</p>
				<p>In a matter of days, the company could not be found in a Google 
				search.</p>
				<p>“Literally, you typed the name of the company into the search 
				box and we did not turn up. Anywhere. You’d find us if you knew 
				our Web address. But in terms of search, we just disappeared.”</p>
				<p>The company now operates under a new name and with a profile 
				that is low even in the building where it claims to have an 
				office. The landlord at the building, a gleaming, glassy midrise 
				next to Route 101 in Redwood City, Calif., said she had never 
				heard of the company.</p>
				<p>Mr. Stevens agreed to meet in mid-January for a dinner paid for 
				by The Times. Asked to pick a “fine restaurant” in his 
				neighborhood, he rather cheekily selected a modern French bistro 
				in Palo Alto offering an eight-course prix fixe meal for $118. 
				Liquid nitrogen and “fairy tale pumpkin” were two of the 
				featured ingredients.</p>
				<p>Mr. Stevens turned out to be a boyish-looking 31-year-old native 
				of Singapore. (Stevens is the name he uses for work; he says he 
				has a Chinese last name, which he did not share.) He speaks with 
				a slight accent and in an animated hush, like a man worried 
				about eavesdroppers. He describes his works with the delighted, 
				mischievous grin of a sophomore who just hid a stink bomb.</p>
				<p>“The key is to roll the campaign out slowly,” he said as he 
				nibbled at seared duck foie gras. “A lot of companies are in a 
				rush. They want as many links as we can get them as fast as 
				possible. But Google will spot that. It will flag a Web site 
				that goes from zero links to a few hundred in a week.”</p>
				<p>The hardest part about the link-selling business, he explained, 
				is signing up deep-pocketed mainstream clients. Lots of them, it 
				seems, are afraid they’ll get caught. Another difficulty is 
				finding quality sites to post links. Whoever set up the 
				JCPenney.com campaign, he said, relied on some really low-rent, 
				spammy sites — the kind with low PageRanks, as Google calls its 
				patented measure of a site’s quality. The higher the PageRank, 
				the more “Google juice” a site offers others to which it is 
				linked.</p>
				<p>“The sites that TNX uses mostly have low PageRanks,” Mr. Stevens 
				said.</p>
				<p>Mr. Stevens said that Web site owners, or publishers, as he 
				calls them, get a small fee for each link, and the transaction 
				is handled entirely over the Web.</p>
				<p>Publishers can reject certain keywords and links — Mr. Stevens 
				said some balked at a lingerie link — but for the most part the 
				system is on a kind of autopilot. A client pays Mr. Stevens and 
				his colleagues for links, which are then farmed out to Web 
				sites. Payment to publishers is handled via PayPal.</p>
				<p>You might expect Mr. Stevens to have a certain amount of 
				contempt for Google, given that he spends his professional life 
				finding ways to subvert it. But through the evening he mentioned 
				a few times that he’s in awe of the company, and the quality of 
				its search engine.</p>
				<p>So how does he justify all his efforts to undermine that engine?</p>
				<p>“I think we need to make a distinction between two different 
				kinds of searches — informational and commercial,” he said. “If 
				you search ‘cancer,’ that’s an informational search and on 
				those, Google is amazing. But in commercial searches, Google’s 
				results are really polluted. My own personal experience says 
				that the guy with the biggest S.E.O. budget always ranks the 
				highest.”</p>
				<p>To Mr. Stevens, S.E.O. is a game, and if you’re not paying black 
				hats, you are losing to rivals with fewer compunctions.</p>
				<p>WHY did Google fail to catch a campaign that had been under way 
				for months? One, no less, that benefited a company that Google 
				had already taken action against three times? And one that 
				relied on a collection of Web sites that were not exactly hiding 
				their spamminess?</p>
				<p>Mr. Cutts emphasized that there are 200 million domain names and 
				a mere 24,000 employees at Google.</p>
				<p>“Spammers never stop,” he said. Battling those spammers is a 
				never-ending job, and one that he believes Google keeps getting 
				better and better at.</p>
				<p>Here’s another hypothesis, this one for the conspiracy-minded. 
				Last year, Advertising Age obtained a Google document that 
				listed some of its largest advertisers, including AT&amp;T, eBay and 
				yes, J. C. Penney. The company, this document said, spent $2.46 
				million a month on paid Google search ads — the kind you see 
				next to organic results.</p>
				<p>Is it possible that Google was willing to countenance an 
				extensive black-hat campaign because it helped one of its larger 
				advertisers? It’s the sort of question that European Union 
				officials are now studying in an investigation of possible 
				antitrust abuses by Google.</p>
				<p>Investigators have been asking advertisers in Europe questions 
				like this: “Please explain whether and, if yes, to what extent 
				your advertising spending with Google has ever had an influence 
				on your ranking in Google’s natural search.” And: “Has Google 
				ever mentioned to you that increasing your advertising spending 
				could improve your ranking in Google’s natural search?”</p>
				<p>Asked if Penney received any breaks because of the money it has 
				spent on ads, Mr. Cutts said, “I’ll give a categorical denial.” 
				He then made an impassioned case for Google’s commitment to 
				separating the money side of the business from the search side. 
				The former has zero influence on the latter, he said.</p>
				<p>“If you asked me for the names of five people in advertising 
				engineering, I don’t think I could give you the names,” he said. 
				“There is a very long history at Google of saying ‘We are not 
				going to worry about short-term revenue.’ ” He added: “We rely 
				on the trust of our users. We realize the responsibility that we 
				have to our users.”</p>
				<p>He noted, too, that before The Times presented evidence of the 
				paid links to JCPenney.com, Google had just begun to roll out an 
				algorithm change that had a negative effect on Penney’s search 
				results. (The tweak affected “how we trust links,” Mr. Cutts 
				said, declining to elaborate.)</p>
				<p>True, JCPenney.com’s showing in Google searches had declined 
				slightly by Feb. 8, as the algorithm change began to take 
				effect. In “comforter sets,” Penney went from No. 1 to No. 7. In 
				“sweater dresses,” from No. 1 to No. 10.</p>
				<p>But the real damage to Penney’s results began when Google 
				started that “manual action.” The decline can be charted: On 
				Feb. 1, the average Penney position for 59 search terms was 1.3.</p>
				<p>On Feb. 8, when the algorithm was changing, it was 4.</p>
				<p>By Feb. 10, it was 52.</p>
				<p>MR. CUTTS said he did not plan to write about Penney’s 
				situation, as he did with BMW in 2006. Rarely, he explained, 
				does he single out a company publicly, because Google’s goal is 
				to preserve the integrity of results, not to embarrass people.</p>
				<p>“But just because we don’t talk about it,” he said, “doesn’t 
				mean we won’t take strong action.”</p>
