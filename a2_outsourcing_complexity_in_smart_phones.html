				<h3>Will Apple’s Culture Hurt the iPhone?</h3>
				<p>NY Times October 17, 2010 By Miguel Heleft</p>
				<p>SAN FRANCISCO — If you want a smartphone powered by Google’s 
				Android software, you could get Motorola’s Droid 2 or its 
				cousin, the Droid X. Then there is the Droid Incredible from 
				HTC, the Fascinate from Samsung and the Ally from LG.<br />
				<br />
				That’s just on Verizon Wireless. An additional 20 or so phones 
				running Android are available in the United States, and there 
				are about 90 worldwide.<br />
				<br />
				But if your preference is an Apple-powered phone, you can buy — 
				an iPhone.<br />
				<br />
				That very short list explains in part why, for all its success 
				in the phone business, Apple suddenly has a real fight on its 
				hands.<br />
				<br />
				Americans now are buying more Android phones than iPhones. If 
				that trend continues, analysts say that in little more than a 
				year, Android will have erased the iPhone’s once enormous lead 
				in the high end of the smartphone market.<br />
				<br />
				But this is not the first time Apple has found itself in this 
				kind of fight, where its flagship product is under siege from a 
				loose alliance of rivals selling dozens of competing gadgets.<br />
				<br />
				In the early 1980s, the Macintosh faced an onslaught of 
				competition from an army of PC makers whose products ran 
				Microsoft software. The fight did not end well for Apple. In a 
				few years, Microsoft all but sidelined Apple, and the company 
				almost went out of business.<br />
				<br />
				Can Apple, which insists on tight control of its devices, win in 
				an intensely competitive market against rivals that are openly 
				licensing their software to scores of companies? It faces that 
				challenge not only in phones, but also in the market for tablet 
				computers, where the iPad is about to take on a similar set of 
				rivals.<br />
				<br />
				“This is a really big strategic question,” said Toni Sacconaghi, 
				an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Company. “No one knows 
				whether openness will ultimately prevail as it did on the PC.”<br />
				<br />
				Apple declined to comment on the issue.<br />
				<br />
				By some measures, the competition Apple faces this time is even 
				more formidable than it was in PCs. In addition to the Android 
				family, Apple already competes with Research In Motion, maker of 
				the BlackBerry.<br />
				<br />
				And the iPhone will soon have one more powerful, and familiar, 
				foe: Microsoft. That company’s well-reviewed Windows Phone 7 
				software will appear in as many as nine new smartphones 
				beginning next month. Others like Nokia cannot be counted out.<br />
				<br />
				The stakes are huge, as the mobile computing market could prove 
				to be larger than the PC market ever was.<br />
				<br />
				No one is counting out Apple, of course. The iPhone 4, which 
				Apple began selling this year, has been its most successful 
				phone introduction yet. On Monday, when the company reports 
				financial results, it is expected to announce that it sold 
				nearly 12 million iPhones in the quarter ending Sept. 25, 
				according to analysts’ estimates. That would represent a 60 
				percent increase from a year earlier.<br />
				<br />
				And with Apple expected to bring the iPhone to Verizon early 
				next year — most likely in an attempt to slow Android’s momentum 
				— the sales growth may well accelerate.<br />
				<br />
				Among investors, there is little doubt that Apple’s strategy is 
				the right one. The company’s stock has soared nearly 50 percent 
				this year, and on Friday it closed at an all-time high of 
				$314.74.<br />
				<br />
				But the rise of Android has been both sudden and unexpected, and 
				its ascent highlights some of the advantages of an open 
				approach.<br />
				<br />
				“There is much more rapid innovation taking place in an open 
				environment,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard 
				Business School who has written recent case studies on Apple. 
				While Apple comes out with a new iPhone model once a year, slick 
				Android phones with new features hit the market often.<br />
				<br />
				That leaves little room for error at Apple. The company must 
				continue to create hit products, as a single misstep could give 
				Android and other rivals an opportunity to make inroads and 
				steal market share.<br />
				<br />
				Also, as the number of people with Android phones grows, Android 
				will grow more attractive for app developers. For now, Apple’s 
				App Store, with more than 250,000 applications, enjoys a large 
				advantage over the Android Market, which has about 80,000. And 
				those numbers don’t tell the whole story. Apps made for the 
				iPhone tend to be of better quality, are more frequently 
				downloaded and on average are more profitable for developers.<br />
				<br />
				But that edge may not last, especially as many developers fret 
				about Apple’s tight control over the App Store.<br />
				<br />
				“Having a tightly controlled ecosystem, which is what Apple has, 
				is a large short-term advantage and a large long-term 
				disadvantage,” said Mitchell Kapor, who as founder of the Lotus 
				Development Corporation is a veteran of the PC-versus-Mac wars, 
				and is now an investor in app makers. “The question is, how long 
				is the short term?”<br />
				<br />
				But for all the similarities in Apple’s approaches to mobile 
				computing and desktop computing, there are plenty of 
				differences, and most analysts doubt that history will repeat 
				itself.<br />
				<br />
				For starters, Apple is the richest company in the technology 
				industry. With $45.8 billion in cash, it can afford to invest 
				heavily in research and development. Apple’s large early lead in 
				devices and developers puts it in a much stronger position than 
				it ever had in the PC market. And because it is one of the 
				largest purchasers of Flash memory, which is one of the most 
				expensive components of a smartphone, it has “enormous economies 
				of scale,” Professor Yoffie said.<br />
				<br />
				What’s more, the iPhone isn’t really fighting alone. The two 
				other devices that run Apple’s iOS mobile software, the iPad and 
				the iPod Touch, further strengthen the iPhone, because consumers 
				like being able to access the content and applications they 
				bought on iTunes and the App Store on multiple devices. Apple 
				has sold more than 120 million iOS devices.<br />
				<br />
				And while Apple’s personal computers were by and large 
				technically superior to Microsoft-based PCs, they were also far 
				more expensive. In the smartphone market, carriers, who play a 
				vital role in distribution, have been willing to subsidize the 
				iPhone so that its cost to consumers is roughly the same as that 
				of comparable Android phones.<br />
				<br />
				For now, the smartphone market is growing so rapidly that the 
				rise of Android has not necessarily been at the expense of the 
				iPhone. That will change as the market matures. But most experts 
				predict that no single company or operating system will rule the 
				mobile market like Microsoft ruled the PC.<br />
				<br />
				“I don’t think we’ll be in a situation where there is one 
				operating system,” said Matt Murphy, a partner at the venture 
				capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, where he manages 
				a fund that invests in applications for iOS devices. “This 
				market will be more fragmented than the PC market.” Mr. Murphy 
				said he expected one or two operating systems to co-exist with 
				Apple’s.<br />
				<br />
				Professor Yoffie agreed: “Apple will lose its overall 
				leadership, but maintain a share of the market that could easily 
				be in the 25 percent to 30 percent range.” He added: “That’s 
				enough to sustain a very large and very profitable business.”</p>
