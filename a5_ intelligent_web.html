				<h3>Entrepreneurs See a Web Guided by Common Sense</h3>
				<p>New York Times, November 12, 2006, John Markoff</p>
				<p>From the billions of documents that form the World Wide Web and 
				the links that weave them together, computer scientists and a 
				growing collection of start-up companies are finding new ways to 
				mine human intelligence.</p>
				<p>Their goal is to add a layer of meaning on top of the existing 
				web that would make it less of a catalog and more of a guide -- 
				and even provide the foundation for systems that can reason in a 
				human fashion. That level of artificial intelligence, with 
				machines doing the thinking instead of simply following 
				commands, has eluded researchers for more than half a century.</p>
				<p>Referred to as Web 3.0, the effort is in its infancy, and the 
				very idea has given rise to skeptics who have called it an 
				unobtainable vision. But the underlying technologies are rapidly 
				gaining adherents, at big companies like IBM. and Google as 
				well as small ones. Their projects often center on simple, 
				practical uses, from producing vacation recommendations to 
				predicting the next hit song.</p>
				<p>But in the future, more powerful systems could act as personal 
				advisers in areas as diverse as financial planning, with an 
				intelligent system mapping out a retirement plan for a couple, 
				for instance, or educational consulting, with the Web helping a 
				high school student identify the right college.</p>
				<p>The projects aimed at creating Web 3.0 all take advantage of 
				increasingly powerful computers that can quickly and completely 
				scour the Web.</p>
				<p>"I call it the World Wide Database," said Nova Spivack, the 
				founder of a start-up firm whose technology detects 
				relationships between nuggets of information by mining the World 
				Wide Web. "We are going from a Web of connected documents to a 
				Web of connected data."</p>
				<p>Web 2.0, which describes the ability to seamlessly connect 
				applications (like geographic mapping) and services (like 
				photo-sharing) over the Internet, has in recent months become 
				the focus of dot-com-style hype in Silicon Valley. But 
				commercial interest in Web 3.0 -- or the "semantic web," for the 
				idea of adding meaning -- is only now emerging.</p>
				<p>The classic example of the Web 2.0 era is the "mash-up" -- for 
				example, connecting a rental-housing Web site with Google Maps 
				to create a new, more useful service that automatically shows 
				the location of each rental listing.</p>
				<p>In contrast, the Holy Grail for developers of the semantic Web 
				is to build a system that can give a reasonable and complete 
				response to a simple question like: "I'm looking for a warm 
				place to vacation and I have a budget of $3,000. Oh, and I have 
				an 11-year-old child."</p>
				<p>Under today's system, such a query can lead to hours of sifting 
				-- through lists of flights, hotel, car rentals -- and the 
				options are often at odds with one another. Under Web 3.0, the 
				same search would ideally call up a complete vacation package 
				that was planned as meticulously as if it had been assembled by 
				a human travel agent.</p>
				<p>How such systems will be built, and how soon they will begin 
				providing meaningful answers, is now a matter of vigorous debate 
				both among academic researchers and commercial technologists. 
				Some are focused on creating a vast new structure to supplant 
				the existing web; others are developing pragmatic tools that 
				extract meaning from the existing web.</p>
				<p>But all agree that if such systems emerge, they will instantly 
				become more commercially valuable than today's search engines, 
				which return thousands or even millions of documents but as a 
				rule do not answer questions directly.</p>
				<p>Underscoring the potential of mining human knowledge is an 
				extraordinarily profitable example: the basic technology that 
				made Google possible, known as "Page Rank," systematically 
				exploits human knowledge and decisions about what is significant 
				to order search results. (It interprets a link from one page to 
				another as a "vote," but votes cast by pages considered popular 
				are weighted more heavily.)</p>
				<p>Today researchers are pushing further. Mr. Spivack's company, 
				Radar Networks, for example, is one of several working to 
				exploit the content of social computing sites, which allow users 
				to collaborate in gathering and adding their thoughts to a wide 
				array of content, from travel to movies.</p>
				<p>Radar's technology is based on a next-generation database system 
				that stores associations, such as one person's relationship to 
				another (colleague, friend, brother), rather than specific items 
				like text or numbers.</p>
				<p>One example that hints at the potential of such systems is 
				KnowItAll, a project by a group of University of Washington 
				faculty members and students that has been financed by Google. 
				One sample system created using the technology is Opine, which 
				is designed to extract and aggregate user-posted information 
				from product and review sites.</p>
				<p>One demonstration project focusing on hotels "understands" 
				concepts like room temperature, bed comfort and hotel price, and 
				can distinguish between concepts like "great," "almost great" 
				and "mostly O.K." to provide useful direct answers. Whereas 
				today's travel recommendation sites force people to weed through 
				long lists of comments and observations left by others, the Web. 
				3.0 system would weigh and rank all of the comments and find, by 
				cognitive deduction, just the right hotel for a particular user.</p>
				<p>"The system will know that spotless is better than clean," said 
				Oren Etzioni, an artificial-intelligence researcher at the 
				University of Washington who is a leader of the project. "There 
				is the growing realization that text on the Web is a tremendous 
				resource."</p>
				<p>In its current state, the web is often described as being in the 
				Lego phase, with all of its different parts capable of 
				connecting to one another. Those who envision the next phase, 
				Web 3.0, see it as an era when machines will start to do 
				seemingly intelligent things.</p>
				<p>Researchers and entrepreneurs say that while it is unlikely that 
				there will be complete artificial-intelligence systems any time 
				soon, if ever, the content of the Web is already growing more 
				intelligent. Smart Webcams watch for intruders, while web-based 
				e-mail programs recognize dates and locations. Such programs, 
				the researchers say, may signal the impending birth of Web 3.0.</p>
				<p>"It's a hot topic, and people haven't realized this spooky thing 
				about how much they are depending on A.I.," said W. Daniel 
				Hillis, a veteran artificial-intelligence researcher who founded 
				Metaweb Technologies here last year.</p>
				<p>Like Radar Networks, Metaweb is still not publicly describing 
				what its service or product will be, though the company's web 
				site states that Metaweb intends to "build a better 
				infrastructure for the web."</p>
				<p>"It is pretty clear that human knowledge is out there and more 
				exposed to machines than it ever was before," Mr. Hillis said.</p>
				<p>Both Radar Networks and Metaweb have their roots in part in 
				technology development done originally for the military and 
				intelligence agencies. Early research financed by the National 
				Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense 
				Advanced Research Projects Agency predated a pioneering call for 
				a semantic Web made in 1999 by Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of 
				the World Wide Web a decade earlier.</p>
				<p>Intelligence agencies also helped underwrite the work of Doug 
				Lenat, a computer scientist whose company, Cycorp of Austin, 
				Tex., sells systems and services to the government and large 
				corporations. For the last quarter-century Mr. Lenat has labored 
				on an artificial-intelligence system named Cyc that he claimed 
				would some day be able to answer questions posed in spoken or 
				written language -- and to reason.</p>
				<p>Cyc was originally built by entering millions of common-sense 
				facts that the computer system would "learn." But in a lecture 
				given at Google earlier this year, Mr. Lenat said, Cyc is now 
				learning by mining the World Wide Web -- a process that is part 
				of how Web 3.0 is being built.</p>
				<p>During his talk, he implied that Cyc is now capable of answering 
				a sophisticated natural-language query like: "Which American 
				city would be most vulnerable to an anthrax attack during 
				summer?"</p>
				<p>Separately, IBM researchers say they are now routinely using 
				a digital snapshot of the six billion documents that make up the 
				non-pornographic World Wide Web to do survey research and answer 
				questions for corporate customers on diverse topics, such as 
				market research and corporate branding.</p>
				<p>Daniel Gruhl, a staff scientist at IBM.'s Almaden Research 
				Center in San Jose, Calif., said the data mining system, known 
				as Web Fountain, has been used to determine the attitudes of 
				young people on death for a insurance company and was able to 
				choose between the terms "utility computing" and "grid 
				computing," for an IBM branding effort.</p>
				<p>"It turned out that only geeks liked the term 'grid computing,' 
				" he said.</p>
				<p>IBM has used the system to do market research for television 
				networks on the popularity of shows by mining a popular online 
				community site, he said. Additionally, by mining the "buzz" on 
				college music web sites, the researchers were able to predict 
				songs that would hit the top of the pop charts in the next two 
				weeks -- a capability more impressive than today's market 
				research predictions.</p>
				<p>There is debate over whether systems like Cyc will be the 
				driving force behind Web 3.0 or whether intelligence will emerge 
				in a more organic fashion, from technologies that systematically 
				extract meaning from the existing web. Those in the latter camp 
				say they see early examples in services like del.icio.us and 
				Flickr, the bookmarking and photo-sharing systems acquired by 
				Yahoo, and Digg, a news service that relies on aggregating the 
				opinions of readers to find stories of interest.</p>
				<p>In Flickr, for example, users "tag" photos, making it simple to 
				identify images in ways that have eluded scientists in the past.</p>
				<p>"With Flickr you can find images that a computer could never 
				find," said Prabhakar Raghavan, head of research at Yahoo. "Something that defied us for 50 years suddenly became trivial. 
				It wouldn't have become trivial without the Web."</p>
