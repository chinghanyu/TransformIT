				<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Have a chat with a chat bot. Try to trip 
				it up. Find an example where it misunderstood you or ignored 
				you, and report it on your web page.<br />
				<strong>A1.</strong> Here is the chat log.</p>
				<p class="centered">
				<img class="pic" alt="" height="707" src="images/a5_ans1_fooling_alice.png" width="803" /><br />
				Figure 1. Fooling A.L.I.C.E.</p>
				<p>Cleary, A.L.I.C.E. is equipped with a database, or more 
				specifically, a knowledge engine, so that 
				it can understand by breaking sentences, looking up key words in 
				the dictionary, and then coming up with a somewhat reasonable 
				answer. However, when there appears some specific words such as 
				'Santa Bot,' which cannot be found in the dictionary, A.L.I.C.E. 
				will try to change the subject, pretending that it forgets the 
				topic we are talking about.</p>
				<p><strong>Q2.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Play a game of 
				Jeopardy against IBM Watson, a general-purpose question 
				answering system at
				<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/06/16/magazine/watson-trivia-game.html?ref=magazine" target="_blank">
				http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/06/16/magazine/watson-trivia-game.html?ref=magazine</a>. 
				Report the score, and provide a screenshot of a question you got 
				right, but Watson couldn’t! <strong>b.</strong> Read the article 
				on 
				<a href="a5_google_now_question_answering_system.html" target="_blank">Google Now</a>, and give some examples of tough questions it can 
				answer better than Siri.<br />
				<strong>A2.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> We led over Watson 5-2.</p>
				<p class="centered">
				<img class="pic" alt="" src="images/a5_ans2_beating_watson.png" width="90%" /><br />
				Figure 2. A question that we were right but Watson could not 
				anwer</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Besides those mentioned in the article, 
				there are still some YouTube video showing the differences 
				between Siri and Google Now. We provide an example here.</p>
				<p class="centered"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/aFDYwo-PJO4?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<br />
				Figure 3. Siri vs. Google Now</p>
				<p>As we can see in the video, Siri has better capability 
				interpreting what its users speak of, whereas Google Now can 
				perform better relevant search. For example, Google Now answers 
				following questions faster or provide better information than 
				Siri does.</p>
				<p>1. What's the capital of France? Google Now immediately 
				popped Paris, but Siri spent sometime to find the answer.<br />
				2. How much is one million and six divided by twenty-four? 
				Google Now again gave the answer on-the-fly, but Siri could not 
				understand the question.<br />
				3. When was Apple founded? Google returned 1976 but Siri had no 
				idea but suggested user to search from the web.<br />
				4. Who invented traffic lights? Siri could not understand the 
				question.</p>
				<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Visit the roboshopper site at
				<a href="http://www.roboshopper.com" target="_blank">
				www.roboshopper.com</a>. Follow the instructions, and search for 
				a specific item relevant to your business. Copy a print-screen 
				of the search results to your web page. Explain what you 
				searched for, how effective and how fast the search was. 
				Alternatively, do the same using mysimon shopping agent at
				<a href="http://www.mysimon.com" target="_blank">www.mysimon.com</a>, 
				or bizrate agent at
				<a href="http://www.bizrate.com" target="_blank">www.bizrate.com</a> 
				or <a href="http://www.pricegrabber.com" target="_blank">
				www.pricegrabber.com</a>. Alternatively create a Google 
				notifying agent at

				by entering your product category so that the agent notifies you 
				whenever someone mentions that product category in a public 
				forum. Wait a day to get an email notification from your agent. 
				Provide a print-screen of the email notification.<br />
				<strong>A3.</strong> We searched for 'dashboard software,' which 
				we strongly encourage our clients to install so that 
				entrepreneurs are able to monitor how well their business is. 
				Sage One appeared to be the first result given by the shopping 
				agent.</p>

				<p><strong>Q4.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Develop a facial 
				animation with speech synthesis using Sitepal or Voki 
				technology. Use it to welcome your visitors to your web site, by 
				inserting the link to your animation. Alternatively, if you have 
				a web cam, go to <a href="http://www.fix8.com" target="_blank">
				www.fix8.com</a>, and use their intelligent mashup technology to 
				superimpose an animation on top of your live video. Provide a 
				link to your video from your a5 page. <strong>b.</strong> Use 
				face detection technology at
				<a href="http://photofunia.com/effects/mount_rushmore" target="_blank">
				http://photofunia.com/effects/mount_rushmore</a> to put your 
				face on Mount Rushmore, or at

				<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Visit Burger King’s subservient chicken 
				ad campaign at
				<a href="http://www.subservientchicken.com/pre_bk_skinned.swf" target="_blank">
				http://www.subservientchicken.com/pre_bk_skinned.swf</a>, and 
				control the chicken’s behavior by typing English commands. 
				Comment on the chicken’s understanding of written English, and 
				give examples of when it failed to understand. Alternatively, 
				use TippEx’s English understanding bear at
				<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tippexperience" target="_blank">
				http://www.youtube.com/user/tippexperience</a> to control the 
				bear’s behavior by typing English commands. Comment on the 
				bear’s understanding of written English, and give examples of 
				when it failed to understand. Alternatively, use dog tricks at
				<a href="http://www.idodogtricks.com/index_flash.html" target="_blank">
				http://www.idodogtricks.com/index_flash.html</a> to control the 
				dog’s behavior by typing English commands. Comment on the dog’s 
				understanding of written English, and give examples of when it 
				failed to understand.<br />
				<strong>A5.</strong> It is obvious that that chicken did 
				understand some English commands. We first tried saying 'hi' and 
				'hello' to the chicken and we saw the chicken waived at the 
				camera. The we tried 'jump,' 'turn around,' and 'fly', and then 
				the chicken did as we wished, of course that chicken was unable 
				to fly. Finally, we asked the chicken to 'jump twice,' or 'tour 
				around three times.' But this time, the chicken only performed 
				once.</p>

				<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Activate speech tools in AT&amp;T Speech or 
				MS Office 2010. Ask it to read an arbitrary text. Copy and paste 
				a screen shot of the interaction into your web site, and 
				identify the words it could not pronounce.<br />

				<p><strong>Q8.</strong> Activate dictation tools in Windows 7, 
				E-speaking, or Hal. Using a microphone, dictate a paragraph. 
				Copy and paste a screen shot of the interaction into your web 
				site, and identify the words it could not understand and typed 
				incorrectly.<br />
				<strong>A8.</strong> It took the commands 
				pretty well. I did a lot of mistakes 
				while typing probably because of accent, but could be because the software 
				is not all that mature. Might be of more help in the future.

				explain how Panasonic is using such systems as customer service 
				representatives. How is it using statistical models to learn?<br />
				<strong>A12.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> </p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Panasonic, concerned about the increasing 
				flow of calls at the customer support desk implemented an 
				automated system of first level resolution of customer problems. 
				They used a statistical model of words and problems to describe 
				the problems after AT&amp;T researchers worked with thousands of 
				hours of recorded calls to the Panasonic center and created a 
				database that was constantly updated. This system was confined 
				to questions like “How may I help you” and some questions to 
				make sure the call was routed to the right team. The cost of 
				resolving a customer issue has declined by 50 percent. It can 
				also sort the problems automatically to prioritize and globalize 
				the customer service.</p>
				<p>	<strong>Q13.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> What is Semantic Web? What 
				tools are used to build it? What capabilities does it add to the 
				existing web? <strong>b.</strong> Read the article on 
				<a href="a5_%20intelligent_web.html" target="_blank">Intelligent 
				Web</a>, and explain how it works and how semantic intelligence can 
				be added to the web, with an example from the article. <strong>c.</strong> 
				Create a semantic web version of a part of your a5.htm page by using 
				the spicynodes software at <a href="http://www.spicynodes.org/index.html"
				 target="_blank">http://www.spicynodes.org/index.html</a>. Save it at that 
				site, and provide a link to it from your a5 page.<br />
				<strong>A13.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> The Semantic Web is a 
				collaborative movement led by the international standards body, 
				the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The standard promotes 
				common data formats on the World Wide Web. According to
				<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Tools" target="_blank">
				W3C's wiki</a>, there are currently 295 tools available for web 
				designers to build their semantic webs. The semantic web, in 
				contrast to the existing webs, extends the network of 
				hyperlinked human-readable web pages by inserting 
				machine-readable metadata about pages and how they are related 
				to each other, enabling automated agents to access the Web more 
				intelligently and perform tasks on behalf of users. For example, 
				a tag in a non-semantic web may like</p>
				<p class="auto-style2">	<strong>&lt;item&gt;</strong>blog<strong>&lt;/item&gt;</strong></p>
				<p>	Encoding similar information in a semantic sense will give 
				us</p>
				<p class="auto-style2">	<strong>&lt;item</strong> <strong>rdf:about="http://techmites.com/semantic-web-a-meaningful-search-engine/"&gt;</strong>blog<strong>&lt;/item&gt;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>	<strong>b.</strong> The current Web 2.0 describes the 
				seamless connection between applications and services. As it 
				evolves to Web 3.0, the semantic web, applications and services 
				are then connected to human knowledge. That is, the web will 
				systematically exploits human knowledge and then decide what to 
				show to its visitors. To make it work, these intelligent webs 
				are first educated through network mining, extracting 
				user-posted information from forum, product, and review sites. 
				One example is Google's Page Rank, which tries to evaluate what 
				is significant to order user's search results. Another is Radar 
				Networks, which relies the next generation database that stores 
				the association to another person instead of numbers or strings.</p>
				<p>	<strong>c.</strong> Please refer to the
