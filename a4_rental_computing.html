				<h3>Microsoft outlines vision of pay-as-you-go computing</h3>
				<p>CNET.com December 2008<br />
				David Meyer</p>
				<h4>Microsoft has applied for a patent on metered, pay-as-you-go 
				computing.</h4>
				<p>U.S. patent application number 20080319910, published on 
				Christmas Day, details Microsoft's vision of a situation where a 
				"standard model" of PC is given away or heavily subsidized by 
				someone in the supply chain. The end user then pays to use the 
				computer, with charges based on both the length of usage time 
				and the performance levels utilized, along with a "one-time 
				charge."</p>
				<p>Microsoft notes in the application that the end user could 
				end up paying more for the computer, compared with the one-off 
				cost entailed in the existing PC business model, but argues the 
				user would benefit by having a PC with an extended "useful 
				life."</p>
				<p>"A computer with scalable performance level components and 
				selectable software and service options has a user interface 
				that allows individual performance levels to be selected," reads 
				the patent application's abstract. The patent application was 
				filed June 21, 2007.</p>
				<p>"The scalable performance level components may include a 
				processor, memory, graphics controller, etc. Software and 
				services may include word processing, email, browsing, database 
				access, etc. To support a pay-per-use business model, each 
				selectable item may have a cost associated with it, allowing a 
				user to pay for the services actually selected and that 
				presumably correspond to the task or tasks being performed," the 
				abstract continues.</p>
				<p>Integral to Microsoft's vision is a security module, embedded 
				in the PC, that would effectively lock the PC to a certain 
				supplier.</p>
				<p>"The metering agents and specific elements of the security 
				module... allow an underwriter in the supply chain to 
				confidently supply a computer at little or no upfront cost to a 
				user or business, aware that their investment is protected and 
				that the scalable performance capabilities generate revenue 
				commensurate with actual performance level settings and usage," 
				the application reads.</p>
				<h4>A more granular approach</h4>
				<p>According to the application, the issue with the existing PC 
				business model is that it "requires more or less a one chance at 
				the consumer kind of mentality, where elasticity curves are 
				based on the pressure to maximize profits on a one-time-sale, 
				one-shot-at-the-consumer mentality."</p>
				<p>Microsoft's proposed model, on the other hand, could "allow a 
				more granular approach to hardware and software sales," the 
				application states, adding that the user "may be able to select 
				a level of performance related to processor, memory, graphics 
				power, etc that is driven not by a lifetime maximum requirement 
				but rather by the need of the moment."</p>
				<p>"When the need is browsing, a low level of performance may be 
				used and, when network-based interactive gaming is the need of 
				the moment, the highest available performance may be made 
				available to the user," the document reads. "Because the user 
				only pays for the performance level of the moment, the user may 
				see no reason to not acquire a device with a high degree of 
				functionality, in terms of both hardware and software, and 
				experiment with a usage level that suits different performance 
				requirements."</p>
				<p>By way of example, the application posits a situation 
				involving three "bundles" of applications and performance: 
				office, gaming, and browsing.</p>
				<p>"The office bundle may include word-processing and 
				spreadsheet applications, medium graphics performance and two of 
				three processor cores," the document reads. "The gaming bundle 
				may include no productivity applications but may include 3D 
				graphics support and three of three processor cores. The 
				browsing bundle may include no productivity applications, medium 
				graphics performance and high-speed network interface."</p>
				<p>"Charging for the various bundles may be by bundle and by 
				duration. For example, the office bundle may be $1.00 [68 pence] 
				per hour, the gaming bundle may be $1.25 per hour and the 
				browsing bundle may be $0.80 per hour. The usage charges may be 
				abstracted to 'units/hour' to make currency conversions simpler. 
				Alternatively, a bundle may incur a one-time charge that is 
				operable until changed or for a fixed-usage period," the 
				document reads.</p>
				<p>Microsoft's patent application does acknowledge that a 
				per-use model of computing would probably increase the cost of 
				ownership over the PC's lifetime. The company argues in its 
				application, however, that "the payments can be deferred and the 
				user can extend the useful life of the computer beyond that of 
				the one-time purchase machine."</p>
				<p>The document suggests that "both users and suppliers benefit 
				from this new business model" because "the user is able to 
				migrate the performance level of the computer as needs change 
				over time, while the supplier can develop a revenue stream 
				business that may actually have higher value than the one-time 
				purchase model currently practiced."</p>
				<p>"Rather than suffering through less-than-adequate performance 
				for a significant portion of the life of a computer, a user can 
				increase performance level over time, at a slight premium of 
				payments," the application reads. "When the performance level 
				finally reaches its maximum and still better performance is 
				required, then the user may upgrade to a new computer, running 
				at a relatively low performance level, probably with little or 
				no change in the cost of use."</p>
