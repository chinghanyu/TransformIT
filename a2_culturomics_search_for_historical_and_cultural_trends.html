				<h3>In 500 Billion Words, New Window on Culture</h3>
				<p>NY Times December 16, 2010<br />
				By PATRICIA COHEN</p>
				<p>With little fanfare, Google has made a mammoth database 
				culled from nearly 5.2 million digitized books available to the 
				public for free downloads and online searches, opening a new 
				landscape of possibilities for research and education in the 
				humanities.</p>
				<p>The digital storehouse, which comprises words and short 
				phrases as well as a year-by-year count of how often they 
				appear, represents the first time a data set of this magnitude 
				and searching tools are at the disposal of Ph.D.’s, middle 
				school students and anyone else who likes to spend time in front 
				of a small screen. It consists of the 500 billion words 
				contained in books published between 1500 and 2008 in English, 
				French, Spanish, German, Chinese, and Russian.</p>
				<p>The intended audience is scholarly, but a simple online tool 
				allows anyone with a computer to plug in a string of up to five 
				words and see a graph that charts the phrase’s use over time — a 
				diversion that can quickly become as addictive as the 
				habit-forming game Angry Birds.</p>
				<p>With a click you can see that “women,” in comparison with 
				“men,” is rarely mentioned until the early 1970s, when feminism 
				gained a foothold. The lines eventually cross paths about 1986.</p>
				<p>You can also learn that Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe don’t 
				get nearly as much attention in print as Jimmy Carter; compare 
				the many more references in English than in Chinese to 
				“Tiananmen Square” after 1989; or follow the ascent of 
				“grilling” from the late 1990s until it outpaced “roasting” and 
				“frying” in 2004.</p>
				<p>“The goal is to give an 8-year-old the ability to browse 
				cultural trends throughout history, as recorded in books,” said 
				Erez Lieberman Aiden, a junior fellow at the Society of Fellows 
				at Harvard. Mr. Lieberman Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel, a 
				postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, assembled the data set with 
				Google and spearheaded a research project to demonstrate how 
				vast digital databases can transform our understanding of 
				language, culture and the flow of ideas.</p>
				<p>Their study, to be published in the journal Science on 
				Friday, offers a tantalizing taste of the rich buffet of 
				research opportunities now open to literature, history and other 
				liberal arts professors who may have previously avoided 
				quantitative analysis. Science is taking the unusual step of 
				making the paper available online to nonsubscribers.</p>
				<p>“We wanted to show what becomes possible when you apply very 
				high-turbo data analysis to questions in the humanities,” said 
				Mr. Lieberman Aiden, whose expertise is in applied mathematics 
				and genomics. He called the method “culturomics.”</p>
				<p>The data set can be downloaded, and users can build their own 
				search tools.</p>
				<p>Working with a version of the data set that included Hebrew 
				and started in 1800, the researchers measured the endurance of 
				fame, finding that written references to celebrities faded twice 
				as quickly in the mid-20th century as they did in the early 
				19th. “In the future everyone will be famous for 7.5 minutes,” 
				they write.</p>
				<p>Looking at inventions, they found technological advances 
				took, on average, 66 years to be adopted by the larger culture 
				in the early 1800s and only 27 years between 1880 and 1920.</p>
				<p>They tracked the way eccentric English verbs that did not add 
				“ed” at the end for past tense (i.e., “learnt”) evolved to 
				conform to the common pattern (“learned”). They figured that the 
				English lexicon has grown by 70 percent to more than a million 
				words in the last 50 years and they demonstrated how 
				dictionaries could be updated more rapidly by pinpointing newly 
				popular words and obsolete ones.</p>
				<p>Steven Pinker, a linguist at Harvard who collaborated on the 
				Science paper’s section about language evolution, has been 
				studying changes in grammar and past tense forms for 20 years.</p>
				<p>“When I saw they had this database, I was quite energized,” 
				he said. “There is so much ignorance. We’ve had to speculate 
				what might have happened to the language.”</p>
				<p>The information about verb changes “makes the results more 
				convincing and more complete,” Mr. Pinker added. “What we report 
				in this paper is just the beginning.”</p>
				<p>Despite the frequent resistance to quantitative analysis in 
				some corners of the humanities, Mr. Pinker said he was confident 
				that the use of this and similar tools would “become universal.”</p>
				<p>Reactions from humanities scholars who quickly reviewed the 
				article were more muted. “In general it’s a great thing to 
				have,” Louis Menand, an English professor at Harvard, said, 
				particularly for linguists. But he warned that in the realm of 
				cultural history, “obviously some of the claims are a little 
				exaggerated.” He was also troubled that, among the paper’s 13 
				named authors, there was not a single humanist involved.</p>
				<p>“There’s not even a historian of the book connected to the 
				project,” Mr. Menand noted.</p>
				<p>Alan Brinkley, the former provost at Columbia and a professor 
				of American history, said it was too early to tell what the 
				impact of word and phrase searches would be. “I could imagine 
				lots of interesting uses, I just don’t know enough about what 
				they’re trying to do statistically,” he said.</p>
				<p>Aware of concerns raised by humanists that the essence of 
				their art is a search for meaning, Mr. Michel and Mr. Lieberman 
				Aiden emphasized that culturomics simply provided information. 
				Interpretation remains essential.</p>
				<p>“I don’t want humanists to accept any specific claims — we’re 
				just throwing a lot of interesting pieces on the table,” Mr. 
				Lieberman Aiden said. “The question is: Are you willing to 
				examine this data?”</p>
				<p>Mr. Michel and Mr. Lieberman Aiden first started their 
				research in 2004 on irregular verbs. Google Books did not exist 
				then, and they had to scrutinize stacks of Anglo-Saxon texts 
				page by page. The process took 18 months.</p>
				<p>“We were exhausted,” Mr. Lieberman Aiden said. That 
				painstaking work “was a total Hail Mary pass; we could have 
				collected this data set and proved nothing.”</p>
				<p>Then they read about Google’s plan to create a digital 
				library and store of every book ever published and recognized 
				that it could revolutionize their research. They approached 
				Peter Norvig, the director of research at Google, about using 
				the collection to do statistical analyses.</p>
				<p>“He realized this was a great opportunity for science and for 
				Google,” Mr. Michel said. “We spent the next four years dealing 
				with the many, many complicated issues that arose,” including 
				legal complications and computational constraints. (A proposed 
				class-action settlement pertaining to copyright and compensation 
				brought by writers and publishers as a result of Google’s 
				digitization plans is pending in the courts.) Google says the 
				culturomics project raises no copyright issue because the books 
				themselves, or even sections of them, cannot be read.</p>
				<p>So far, Google has scanned more than 11 percent of the entire 
				corpus of published books, about two trillion words. The data 
				analyzed in the paper contains about 4 percent of the corpus.</p>
				<p>The warehouse of words makes it possible to analyze cultural 
				influences statistically in a way previously not possible. 
				Cultural references tend to appear in print much less frequently 
				than everyday words, said Mr. Michel, whose expertise is in 
				applied math and systems biology. An accurate picture needs a 
				huge sample. Checking if “sasquatch” has infiltrated the culture 
				requires a supply of at least a billion words a year, he said.</p>
				<p>As for culturomics? In 20 years, type the word into an 
				updated version of the database and see what happens.</p>
