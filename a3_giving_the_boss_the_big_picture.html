				<h3>A "Dashboard" Pulls up Everything the CEO Needs to Run the 
				Show </h3>
				<p>It was New Year's Eve, 2003, and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) CEO 
				Lawrence J. Ellison was on his honeymoon. He and his bride, 
				romance novelist Melanie Craft, were relaxing on his 243-foot 
				Katana yacht off St. Barts, the Caribbean island known as a 
				haven for movie moguls and rock stars. But Ellison, for the 
				umpteenth time, couldn't help himself. He climbed to his office 
				on the upper deck of the Katana, fired up his computer, and 
				logged on to the Web site of a small company called NetSuite 
				Inc. It was the last day of the fiscal year, and Ellison, the 
				co-founder of NetSuite and its largest investor, needed to know 
				if the startup was going to meet its numbers.</p>
				<p>Before the Internet, Ellison says, taking the pulse of a 
				company was sort of ridiculous. To get the latest sales 
				information, he would call several people and wait days for them 
				to process financial reports that often were out of date by the 
				time he got them. "You would use your cell phone and work on 
				feelings," he says.</p>
				<p>But thanks to a new Web-based management tool known as a 
				dashboard, Ellison had the information he needed in seconds. 
				Like the instrument panel in a car, the computer version 
				displays critical info in easy-to-read graphics, assembled from 
				data pulled in real time from corporate software programs. 
				Logging on to his dashboard for NetSuite, Ellison reviewed the 
				financial data and saw surprisingly strong sales. He quickly 
				called NetSuite CEO Zachary A. Nelson. Recalls Nelson: "The 
				first thing he screams is: 'Are the numbers on my dashboard 
				right?"' Nelson looked at his own dashboard, but his sales data 
				were lower. So he pushed a refresh button. "The information came 
				up with the new orders, and it was the exact same number," says 
				Nelson. "It was a very big high-five call."</p>
				<p>Since the advent of the mainframe in the 1950s, companies 
				have dreamed of using computers to manage their businesses. But 
				early efforts came up short, with technology that was too costly 
				or too clunky. Now, thanks to the Net and dashboards, those 
				dreams are starting to come true. Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) 
				analyst Keith Gile estimates that 40% of the 2,000 largest 
				companies use the technology. Some of the most prominent chief 
				executives in the world are believers, from Steven A. Ballmer at 
				Microsoft (MSFT) and Ivan G. Seidenberg at Verizon 
				Communications (VZ) to Robert L. Nardelli at Home Depot (HD). 
				"The dashboard puts me and more and more of our executives in 
				real-time touch with the business," says Seidenberg. "The more 
				eyes that see the results we're obtaining every day, the higher 
				the quality of the decisions we can make."</p>
				<p>The dashboard is the CEO's killer app, making the gritty 
				details of a business that are often buried deep within a large 
				organization accessible at a glance to senior executives. So 
				powerful are the programs that they're beginning to change the 
				nature of management, from an intuitive art into more of a 
				science. Managers can see key changes in their businesses almost 
				instantaneously -- when salespeople falter or quality slides -- 
				and take quick, corrective action. At Verizon, Seidenberg and 
				other executives can choose from among 300 metrics to put on 
				their dashboards, from broadband sales to wireless subscriber 
				defections. At General Electric Co. (GE), James P. Campbell, 
				chief of the Consumer &amp; Industrial division, which makes 
				appliances and lighting products, tracks the number of orders 
				coming in from each customer every day and compares that with 
				targets. "I look at the digital dashboard the first thing in the 
				morning so I have a quick global view of sales and service 
				levels across the organization," says Campbell. "It's a key 
				operational tool in our business."</p>
				<p>The technology is particularly valuable to small companies, 
				since most of them couldn't afford sophisticated software in the 
				past. Up until about five years ago, dashboards had to be custom 
				built, so the expense could run into the millions of dollars. 
				Now, NetSuite and others offer products that run $1,000 to 
				$2,000 a year per user. "NetSuite brought on a total change in 
				the way the company works and thinks," says Nate Porter, 
				vice-president of American Reporting Co., a Kirkland (Wash.) 
				provider of credit reports and other mortgage services.</p>
				<h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
				<p>Still, dashboards have drawn some flak. Critics say CEOs can 
				miss the big picture if they're glued to their computer screens. 
				GE agrees with that point. While business unit chiefs such as 
				Campbell are active dashboard users, CEO Jeffrey Immelt is not, 
				since he focuses on issues such as broad strategy and dealmaking 
				that the technology can't yet capture.</p>
				<p>Other critics fear dashboards are an alluring but destructive 
				force, the latest incarnation of Big Brother. The concern is 
				that companies will use the technology to invade the privacy of 
				workers and wield it as a whip to keep them in line. Even 
				managers who use dashboards admit the tools can raise pressure 
				on employees, create divisions in the office, and lead workers 
				to hoard information.</p>
				<p>One common concern is that dashboards can hurt morale. Consider 
				the case of Little Earth Productions Inc., a Pittsburgh clothing 
				manufacturer. The company uses NetSuite's tools to monitor the 
				amount of business each salesperson has brought in and then 
				displays it publicly. "You do feel bummed out sometimes if you 
				are low on the list," says Ronisue Koller, a Little Earth 
				salesperson.</p>
				<p>Those pressures can lead to even bigger disruptions. NetSuite 
				CEO Nelson says his dashboard allows him to read every e-mail 
				sent by the sales staff and to inspect the leads of each 
				salesperson. "It's frightening," he says. And it can have 
				serious consequences. Once a month, Nelson plays "lead fairy" 
				and looks at what sales leads have been followed up on and which 
				ones haven't. One salesman quit when Nelson wrested away his 
				sales leads that were not being used and gave them to others who 
				were out of leads. "This raised enormous hackles in the 
				company," says Nelson. "That's fine with me because he wasn't 
				doing his job anyway."</p>
				<p>Still, most management experts think the rewards are well worth 
				the risks. They caution that executives should roll out the 
				systems slowly and avoid highlighting individual performance, at 
				least at first. They also underscore the need for business 
				leaders to spend time up-front figuring out which metrics are 
				the most useful to track. But that's a question of how to use 
				the technology, not whether to implement it. "You can't manage 
				something you can't measure," says Ken Rau, managing partner at 
				Bay Area Consulting Group LLC in San Francisco. "Dashboards are 
				one of management's key techniques to make sure an organization 
				is performing according to its objectives."</p>
				<p>The intellectual foundation for dashboards was laid down in the 
				late 1970s with the academic field of decision support systems. 
				DSS introduced the idea that computer systems could be used to 
				aid the process of decision-making. But it wasn't until the late 
				1990s, as the Internet linked up computers around the world, 
				that companies began building the dashboards of today. In 1998, 
				GE was one of the first companies to cobble together its own 
				proprietary technology. The trend picked up steam after the 
				recession of 2001, when efficiency became a priority. In the 
				past few years, a new wave of software makers -- including 
				NetSuite, Salesforce.com (CRM), and Hyperion Solutions (HYSL) 
				-- have begun making dashboards that are even cheaper and easier 
				to use.</p>
				<h3>A Must-Have</h3>
				<p>Netsuite, based in San Mateo, Calif., was founded in 1998 by 
				Ellison and Evan Goldberg, a former top software engineer at 
				Oracle. In 2002, Nelson took over the company after leaving 
				Network Associates. Today the company offers everything from 
				dashboards to marketing software to tools for setting up an 
				e-commerce Web site. NetSuite claims more than 7,000 customers, 
				most of them small and midsize businesses. In 2005, it was the 
				second-fastest-growing technology company in North America based 
				on five-year sales growth, according to consultant Deloitte. And 
				last year it was on track to hit $70 million in sales, up from 
				$41 million in 2004.</p>
				<p>One big fan of dashboards is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which of 
				course makes plenty of business software itself. Jeff Raikes, 
				president of the Microsoft division that makes its Microsoft 
				Office software, says that more than half of its employees use 
				dashboards, including Ballmer and chief software architect 
				William H. Gates III. "Every time I go to see Ballmer, it's an 
				expectation that I bring my dashboard with me," says Raikes. 
				Ballmer, he says, reviews the dashboards of his seven business 
				heads during one-on-one meetings, zeroing in on such metrics as 
				sales, customer satisfaction, and the status of key products 
				under development.</p>
				<p>As for Gates, Raikes says the Microsoft founder uses a dashboard 
				during his "think week," when he leaves the office and reads 
				more than 100 papers about the tech industry prepared by 
				employees. "He uses the dashboard to track what he has read and 
				the feedback and actions that should be taken," says Raikes.</p>
				<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
				<p>Dashboards are a natural for monitoring operations. In 
				manufacturing, GE execs use them to follow the production of 
				everything from lightbulbs to dishwashers, making sure 
				production lines are running smoothly. In the software business, 
				Raikes uses his dashboard to track the progress of the upcoming 
				version of Office. Shaygan Kheradpir, the chief information 
				officer at Verizon, has on his dashboard what co-workers call 
				the Wall of Shaygan, a replica of every single node on the 
				telecom giant's network. All green is good. Yellow or red merits 
				a click. Red means an outage somewhere. "It makes you move where 
				you need to move," he says.</p>
				<p>Dashboard technology can help keep customers happy, too. Before 
				NetSuite, American Reporting's Porter says customer-service reps 
				just answered the phone and had no place to store client 
				requests. Now the company's entire customer-service team uses 
				the software. As a result, customer-service managers can see who 
				is responding to calls. And service reps have access to every 
				repair ticket, making it easier to handle customer problems. "It 
				allows us to compete against some of the bigger boys," says 
				Porter.</p>
				<p>American Reporting isn't the only small fry that's benefiting. 
				Jerry Driggs, chief operating office of Little Earth, took four 
				months last winter to move his business onto the NetSuite 
				system. Little Earth sells funky eco-fashion products, such as a 
				handbag made with recycled license plates. Today half of the 
				company's 50 employees use the system to manage their 
				production, sales, and financial operations. "Once you see it is 
				so intuitive, you wonder how we ran the business before," says 
				Driggs.</p>
				<p>In fact, Driggs ran the business by the seat of his pants, and 
				it showed. Because the company had no system to measure its 
				production requirements or level of raw materials, much of which 
				came from China, it took about six weeks to make and ship a 
				handbag. And Little Earth constantly struggled with cash 
				problems because Driggs would often buy more trim pieces and 
				twist-knob closures than he needed. "You used to see dollars 
				sitting on the shelves," he says. Now, using NetSuite, Driggs 
				can monitor his purchase orders and inventory levels, and the 
				system even alerts him when he is running low on closures and 
				other parts. The result: Little Earth has slashed its shipping 
				time to three days. "All of those things that used to drive us 
				crazy are literally at our fingertips," says Driggs.</p>
				<p>If it's near the end of a financial quarter, Oracle's Ellison 
				tracks his customers like a hawk. "I want to know what our five 
				biggest deals are three days before the quarter closes," he 
				says. "I look at the [dashboard] several times a day. So much of 
				our sales activity gets compressed into a few days." Ellison 
				will then call the companies himself or figure out another way 
				to seal the deal.</p>
				<p>Since his honeymoon two years ago, Ellison has become more 
				convinced than ever that dashboards are the way of the future. 
				He just wishes more of his employees thought the way he does. 
				One continuing frustration is that although all of Oracle's 
				20,000 salespeople use dashboards, Ellison says some 20% of them 
				refuse to enter their sales leads into the system. Salespeople 
				don't want to be held accountable for a lead that isn't 
				converted into a sale. That makes it hard to get a true picture 
				of the demand for Oracle's products.</p>
				<p>Ellison has considered refusing to pay commissions on a sale if 
				the order is not entered into a dashboard, but for now he thinks 
				such a move might prove to be a bit draconian. "The salespeople 
				are the last of the independents," says Ellison. "They think 
				their Rolodex is private." Even Ellison, one of the world's 
				richest men, concedes that technology -- and the power it gives 
				him -- has it limits. "People have to be persuaded that it's 
				right," he says.</p>
