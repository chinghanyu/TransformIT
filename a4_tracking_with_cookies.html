				<h3>The Web's New Gold Mine: Your Secrets</h3>
				<p>Wall Street Journal, July 30 2010<br />
				By JULIA ANGWIN<br />
				</p>
				<p>Hidden inside Ashley Hayes-Beaty's computer, a tiny file 
				helps gather personal details about her, all to be put up for 
				sale for a tenth of a penny.</p>
				<p>The file consists of a single code — 
				4c812db292272995e5416a323e79bd37 — that secretly identifies her 
				as a 26-year-old female in Nashville, Tenn.</p>
				<p>The code knows that her favorite movies include "The Princess 
				Bride," "50 First Dates" and "10 Things I Hate About You." It 
				knows she enjoys the "Sex and the City" series. It knows she 
				browses entertainment news and likes to take quizzes.</p>
				<p>"Well, I like to think I have some mystery left to me, but 
				apparently not!" Ms. Hayes-Beaty said when told what that 
				snippet of code reveals about her. "The profile is eerily 
				correct."</p>
				<p>In an interview with WSJ's Alan Murray, WPP CEO Sir Martin 
				Sorrell conceded that advertisers must do better to inform 
				customers about the tracking and mapping of online behavior. On 
				the U.S. economy, he characterized the last 6-7 months as 
				"America Bites Back" but wonders how long the recovery will 
				last.</p>
				<p>Ms. Hayes-Beaty is being monitored by Lotame Solutions Inc., 
				a New York company that uses sophisticated software called a 
				"beacon" to capture what people are typing on a website—their 
				comments on movies, say, or their interest in parenting and 
				pregnancy. Lotame packages that data into profiles about 
				individuals, without determining a person's name, and sells the 
				profiles to companies seeking customers. Ms. Hayes-Beaty's 
				tastes can be sold wholesale (a batch of movie lovers is $1 per 
				thousand) or customized (26-year-old Southern fans of "50 First 
				Dates").</p>
				<p>"We can segment it all the way down to one person," says Eric 
				Porres, Lotame's chief marketing officer.</p>
				<p>One of the fastest-growing businesses on the Internet, a Wall 
				Street Journal investigation has found, is the business of 
				spying on Internet users.</p>
				<p>Ashley Hayes-Beaty's taste in film is tracked by a New York 
				firm — and offered for sale for a tenth of a cent.</p>
				<p>The Journal conducted a comprehensive study that assesses and 
				analyzes the broad array of cookies and other surveillance 
				technology that companies are deploying on Internet users. It 
				reveals that the tracking of consumers has grown both far more 
				pervasive and far more intrusive than is realized by all but a 
				handful of people in the vanguard of the industry.</p>
				<p>‧ The study found that the nation's 50 top websites on 
				average installed 64 pieces of tracking technology onto the 
				computers of visitors, usually with no warning. A dozen sites 
				each installed more than a hundred. The nonprofit Wikipedia 
				installed none.</p>
				<p>‧ Tracking technology is getting smarter and more intrusive. 
				Monitoring used to be limited mainly to "cookie" files that 
				record websites people visit. But the Journal found new tools 
				that scan in real time what people are doing on a Web page, then 
				instantly assess location, income, shopping interests and even 
				medical conditions. Some tools surreptitiously re-spawn 
				themselves even after users try to delete them.</p>
				<p>‧ These profiles of individuals, constantly refreshed, are 
				bought and sold on stock-market-like exchanges that have sprung 
				up in the past 18 months.</p>
				<p>The new technologies are transforming the Internet economy. 
				Advertisers once primarily bought ads on specific Web pages—a 
				car ad on a car site. Now, advertisers are paying a premium to 
				follow people around the Internet, wherever they go, with highly 
				specific marketing messages.</p>
				<p>Surfing the Internet kickstarts a process that passes 
				information about you and your interests to tracking companies 
				and advertisers. See how it works.</p>
				<p>In between the Internet user and the advertiser, the Journal 
				identified more than 100 middlemen—tracking companies, data 
				brokers and advertising networks—competing to meet the growing 
				demand for data on individual behavior and interests.</p>
				<p>The data on Ms. Hayes-Beaty's film-watching habits, for 
				instance, is being offered to advertisers on BlueKai Inc., one 
				of the new data exchanges.</p>
				<p>"It is a sea change in the way the industry works," says Omar 
				Tawakol, CEO of BlueKai. "Advertisers want to buy access to 
				people, not Web pages."</p>
				<p>The Journal examined the 50 most popular U.S. websites, which 
				account for about 40% of the Web pages viewed by Americans. (The 
				Journal also tested its own site, WSJ.com.) It then analyzed the 
				tracking files and programs these sites downloaded onto a test 
				computer.</p>
				<p>As a group, the top 50 sites placed 3,180 tracking files in 
				total on the Journal's test computer. Nearly a third of these 
				were innocuous, deployed to remember the password to a favorite 
				site or tally most-popular articles.</p>
				<p>But over two-thirds—2,224—were installed by 131 companies, 
				many of which are in the business of tracking Web users to 
				create rich databases of consumer profiles that can be sold.</p>
				<p>The top venue for such technology, the Journal found, was 
				IAC/InterActive Corp.'s Dictionary.com. A visit to the online 
				dictionary site resulted in 234 files or programs being 
				downloaded onto the Journal's test computer, 223 of which were 
				from companies that track Web users.</p>
				<p>The information that companies gather is anonymous, in the 
				sense that Internet users are identified by a number assigned to 
				their computer, not by a specific person's name. Lotame, for 
				instance, says it doesn't know the name of users such as Ms. 
				Hayes-Beaty—only their behavior and attributes, identified by 
				code number. People who don't want to be tracked can remove 
				themselves from Lotame's system.</p>
				<p>And the industry says the data are used harmlessly. David 
				Moore, chairman of 24/7 RealMedia Inc., an ad network owned by 
				WPP PLC, says tracking gives Internet users better advertising.</p>
				<p>"When an ad is targeted properly, it ceases to be an ad, it 
				becomes important information," he says.</p>
				<p>Tracking isn't new. But the technology is growing so powerful 
				and ubiquitous that even some of America's biggest sites say 
				they were unaware, until informed by the Journal, that they were 
				installing intrusive files on visitors' computers.</p>
				<p>The Journal found that Microsoft Corp.'s popular Web portal, 
				MSN.com, planted a tracking file packed with data: It had a 
				prediction of a surfer's age, ZIP Code and gender, plus a code 
				containing estimates of income, marital status, presence of 
				children and home ownership, according to the tracking company 
				that created the file, Targus Information Corp.</p>
				<p>Both Targus and Microsoft said they didn't know how the file 
				got onto MSN.com, and added that the tool didn't contain 
				"personally identifiable" information.</p>
				<p>Tracking is done by tiny files and programs known as 
				"cookies," "Flash cookies" and "beacons." They are placed on a 
				computer when a user visits a website. U.S. courts have ruled 
				that it is legal to deploy the simplest type, cookies, just as 
				someone using a telephone might allow a friend to listen in on a 
				conversation. Courts haven't ruled on the more complex trackers.</p>
				<p>The most intrusive monitoring comes from what are known in 
				the business as "third party" tracking files. They work like 
				this: The first time a site is visited, it installs a tracking 
				file, which assigns the computer a unique ID number. Later, when 
				the user visits another site affiliated with the same tracking 
				company, it can take note of where that user was before, and 
				where he is now. This way, over time the company can build a 
				robust profile.</p>
				<p>One such ecosystem is Yahoo Inc.'s ad network, which collects 
				fees by placing targeted advertisements on websites. Yahoo's 
				network knows many things about recent high-school graduate Cate 
				Reid. One is that she is a 13- to 18-year-old female interested 
				in weight loss. Ms. Reid was able to determine this when a 
				reporter showed her a little-known feature on Yahoo's website, 
				the Ad Interest Manager, that displays some of the information 
				Yahoo had collected about her.</p>
				<p>Yahoo's take on Ms. Reid, who was 17 years old at the time, 
				hit the mark: She was, in fact, worried that she may be 15 
				pounds too heavy for her 5-foot, 6-inch frame. She says she 
				often does online research about weight loss.</p>
				<p>"Every time I go on the Internet," she says, she sees 
				weight-loss ads. "I'm self-conscious about my weight," says Ms. 
				Reid, whose father asked that her hometown not be given. "I try 
				not to think about it…. Then [the ads] make me start thinking 
				about it."</p>
				<p>Yahoo spokeswoman Amber Allman says Yahoo doesn't knowingly 
				target weight-loss ads at people under 18, though it does target 
				adults.</p>
				<p>"It's likely this user received an untargeted ad," Ms. Allman 
				says. It's also possible Ms. Reid saw ads targeted at her by 
				other tracking companies.</p>
				<p>Information about people's moment-to-moment thoughts and 
				actions, as revealed by their online activity, can change hands 
				quickly. Within seconds of visiting eBay.com or Expedia.com, 
				information detailing a Web surfer's activity there is likely to 
				be auctioned on the data exchange run by BlueKai, the Seattle 
				startup.</p>
				<p>Each day, BlueKai sells 50 million pieces of information like 
				this about specific individuals' browsing habits, for as little 
				as a tenth of a cent apiece. The auctions can happen instantly, 
				as a website is visited.</p>
				<p>Spokespeople for eBay Inc. and Expedia Inc. both say the 
				profiles BlueKai sells are anonymous and the people aren't 
				identified as visitors of their sites. BlueKai says its own 
				website gives consumers an easy way to see what it monitors 
				about them.</p>
				<p>Tracking files get onto websites, and downloaded to a 
				computer, in several ways. Often, companies simply pay sites to 
				distribute their tracking files.</p>
				<p>But tracking companies sometimes hide their files within free 
				software offered to websites, or hide them within other tracking 
				files or ads. When this happens, websites aren't always aware 
				that they're installing the files on visitors' computers.</p>
				<p>Often staffed by "quants," or math gurus with expertise in 
				quantitative analysis, some tracking companies use probability 
				algorithms to try to pair what they know about a person's online 
				behavior with data from offline sources about household income, 
				geography and education, among other things.</p>
				<p>The goal is to make sophisticated assumptions in real 
				time—plans for a summer vacation, the likelihood of repaying a 
				loan—and sell those conclusions.</p>
				<p>Some financial companies are starting to use this formula to 
				show entirely different pages to visitors, based on assumptions 
				about their income and education levels.</p>
				<p>Life-insurance site AccuquoteLife.com, a unit of Byron Udell 
				&amp; Associates Inc., last month tested a system showing visitors 
				it determined to be suburban, college-educated baby-boomers a 
				default policy of $2 million to $3 million, says Accuquote 
				executive Sean Cheyney. A rural, working-class senior citizen 
				might see a default policy for $250,000, he says.</p>
				<p>"We're driving people down different lanes of the highway," 
				Mr. Cheyney says.</p>
				<p>Consumer tracking is the foundation of an online advertising 
				economy that racked up $23 billion in ad spending last year. 
				Tracking activity is exploding. Researchers at AT&amp;T Labs and 
				Worcester Polytechnic Institute last fall found tracking 
				technology on 80% of 1,000 popular sites, up from 40% of those 
				sites in 2005.</p>
				<p>The Journal found tracking files that collect sensitive 
				health and financial data. On Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.'s 
				dictionary website Merriam-Webster.com, one tracking file from 
				Healthline Networks Inc., an ad network, scans the page a user 
				is viewing and targets ads related to what it sees there. So, 
				for example, a person looking up depression-related words could 
				see Healthline ads for depression treatments on that page—and on 
				subsequent pages viewed on other sites.</p>
				<p>Healthline says it doesn't let advertisers track users around 
				the Internet who have viewed sensitive topics such as HIV/AIDS, 
				sexually transmitted diseases, eating disorders and impotence. 
				The company does let advertisers track people with bipolar 
				disorder, overactive bladder and anxiety, according to its 
				marketing materials.</p>
				<p>Targeted ads can get personal. Last year, Julia Preston, a 
				32-year-old education-software designer in Austin, Texas, 
				researched uterine disorders online. Soon after, she started 
				noticing fertility ads on sites she visited. She now knows she 
				doesn't have a disorder, but still gets the ads.</p>
				<p>It's "unnerving," she says.</p>
				<p>Tracking became possible in 1994 when the tiny text files 
				called cookies were introduced in an early browser, Netscape 
				Navigator. Their purpose was user convenience: remembering 
				contents of Web shopping carts.</p>
				<p>Back then, online advertising barely existed. The first 
				banner ad appeared the same year. When online ads got rolling 
				during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, advertisers were 
				buying ads based on proximity to content—shoe ads on fashion 
				sites.</p>
				<p>The dot-com bust triggered a power shift in online 
				advertising, away from websites and toward advertisers. 
				Advertisers began paying for ads only if someone clicked on 
				them. Sites and ad networks began using cookies aggressively in 
				hopes of showing ads to people most likely to click on them, 
				thus getting paid.</p>
				<p>Targeted ads command a premium. Last year, the average cost 
				of a targeted ad was $4.12 per thousand viewers, compared with 
				$1.98 per thousand viewers for an untargeted ad, according to an 
				ad-industry-sponsored study in March.</p>
				<p>The Journal examined three kinds of tracking technology—basic 
				cookies as well as more powerful "Flash cookies" and bits of 
				software code called "beacons."</p>
				<p>More than half of the sites examined by the Journal installed 
				23 or more "third party" cookies. Dictionary.com installed the 
				most, placing 159 third-party cookies.</p>
				<p>Cookies are typically used by tracking companies to build 
				lists of pages visited from a specific computer. A newer type of 
				technology, beacons, can watch even more activity.</p>
				<p>Beacons, also known as "Web bugs" and "pixels," are small 
				pieces of software that run on a Web page. They can track what a 
				user is doing on the page, including what is being typed or 
				where the mouse is moving.</p>
				<p>The majority of sites examined by the Journal placed at least 
				seven beacons from outside companies. Dictionary.com had the 
				most, 41, including several from companies that track health 
				conditions and one that says it can target consumers by dozens 
				of factors, including zip code and race.</p>
				<p>Dictionary.com President Shravan Goli attributed the presence 
				of so many tracking tools to the fact that the site was working 
				with a large number of ad networks, each of which places its own 
				cookies and beacons. After the Journal contacted the company, it 
				cut the number of networks it uses and beefed up its privacy 
				policy to more fully disclose its practices.</p>
				<p>The widespread use of Adobe Systems Inc.'s Flash software to 
				play videos online offers another opportunity to track people. 
				Flash cookies originally were meant to remember users' 
				preferences, such as volume settings for online videos.</p>
				<p>But Flash cookies can also be used by data collectors to 
				re-install regular cookies that a user has deleted. This can 
				circumvent a user's attempt to avoid being tracked online. Adobe 
				condemns the practice.</p>
				<p>Most sites examined by the Journal installed no Flash 
				cookies. Comcast.net installed 55.</p>
				<p>That finding surprised the company, which said it was unaware 
				of them. Comcast Corp. subsequently determined that it had used 
				a piece of free software from a company called Clearspring 
				Technologies Inc. to display a slideshow of celebrity photos on 
				Comcast.net. The Flash cookies were installed on Comcast's site 
				by that slideshow, according to Comcast.</p>
				<p>Clearspring, based in McLean, Va., says the 55 Flash cookies 
				were a mistake. The company says it no longer uses Flash cookies 
				for tracking.</p>
				<p>CEO Hooman Radfar says Clearspring provides software and 
				services to websites at no charge. In exchange, Clearspring 
				collects data on consumers. It plans eventually to sell the data 
				it collects to advertisers, he says, so that site users can be 
				shown "ads that don't suck." Comcast's data won't be used, 
				Clearspring says.</p>
				<p>Wittingly or not, people pay a price in reduced privacy for 
				the information and services they receive online. 
				Dictionary.com, the site with the most tracking files, is a case 
				study.</p>
				<p>The site's annual revenue, about $9 million in 2009 according 
				to an SEC filing, means the site is too small to support an 
				extensive ad-sales team. So it needs to rely on the national 
				ad-placing networks, whose business model is built on tracking.</p>
				<p>Dictionary.com executives say the trade-off is fair for their 
				users, who get free access to its dictionary and thesaurus 
				service.</p>
				<p>"Whether it's one or 10 cookies, it doesn't have any impact 
				on the customer experience, and we disclose we do it," says 
				Dictionary.com spokesman Nicholas Graham. "So what's the beef?"</p>
				<p>The problem, say some industry veterans, is that so much 
				consumer data is now up for sale, and there are no legal limits 
				on how that data can be used.</p>
				<p>Until recently, targeting consumers by health or financial 
				status was considered off-limits by many large Internet ad 
				companies. Now, some aim to take targeting to a new level by 
				tapping online social networks.</p>
				<p>Media6Degrees Inc., whose technology was found on three sites 
				by the Journal, is pitching banks to use its data to size up 
				consumers based on their social connections. The idea is that 
				the creditworthy tend to hang out with the creditworthy, and 
				deadbeats with deadbeats.</p>
				<p>"There are applications of this technology that can be very 
				powerful," says Tom Phillips, CEO of Media6Degrees. "Who knows 
				how far we'd take it?"</p>
