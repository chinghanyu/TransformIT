				<h3>How Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did?</h3>
				
				<p>Target has got you in its aim.</p>
				<p>Every time you go shopping, you share intimate details about 
				your consumption patterns with retailers. And many of those 
				retailers are studying those details to figure out what you 
				like, what you need, and which coupons are most likely to make 
				you happy. Target, for example, has figured out how to data-mine 
				its way into your womb, to figure out whether you have a baby on 
				the way long before you need to start buying diapers.</p>
				<p>Charles Duhigg outlines in the New York Times how Target 
				tries to hook parents-to-be at that crucial moment before they 
				turn into rampant — and loyal — buyers of all things pastel, 
				plastic, and miniature. He talked to Target statistician Andrew 
				Pole — before Target freaked out and cut off all communications 
				— about the clues to a customer’s impending bundle of joy. 
				Target assigns every customer a Guest ID number, tied to their 
				credit card, name, or email address that becomes a bucket that 
				stores a history of everything they’ve bought and any 
				demographic information Target has collected from them or bought 
				from other sources. Using that, Pole looked at historical buying 
				data for all the ladies who had signed up for Target baby 
				registries in the past:</p>
				<p>[Pole] ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before 
				long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of 
				people buy lotion, but one of Pole’s colleagues noticed that 
				women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of 
				unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. 
				Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, 
				pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium 
				and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when 
				someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and 
				extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers 
				and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their 
				delivery date.</p>
				<p>Or have a rather nasty infection…</p>
				<p>As Pole’s computers crawled through the data, he was able to 
				identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed 
				him to assign each shopper a “pregnancy prediction” score. More 
				important, he could also estimate her due date to within a small 
				window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific 
				stages of her pregnancy.</p>
				<p>One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical 
				example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who 
				is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, 
				a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and 
				magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There’s, say, an 87 
				percent chance that she’s pregnant and that her delivery date is 
				sometime in late August.</p>
				<p>Target knows before it shows. So Target started sending 
				coupons for baby items to customers according to their pregnancy 
				scores. Duhigg shares an anecdote — so good that it sounds made 
				up — that conveys how eerily accurate the targeting is. An angry 
				man went into a Target outside of Minneapolis, demanding to talk 
				to a manager:</p>
				<p>“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in 
				high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and 
				cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”</p>
				<p>The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking 
				about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to 
				the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity 
				clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The 
				manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize 
				again.</p>
				<p>On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had 
				a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been 
				some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. 
				She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”</p>
				<p>What Target discovered fairly quickly is that it creeped 
				people out that the company knew about their pregnancies in 
				advance.</p>
				<p>“If we send someone a catalog and say, ‘Congratulations on 
				your first child!’ and they’ve never told us they’re pregnant, 
				that’s going to make some people uncomfortable,” Pole told me. 
				“We are very conservative about compliance with all privacy 
				laws. But even if you’re following the law, you can do things 
				where people get queasy.”</p>
				<p>Bold is mine. That’s a quote for our times.</p>
				<p>So Target got sneakier about sending the coupons. The company 
				can create personalized booklets; instead of sending people with 
				high pregnancy scores books o’ coupons solely for diapers, 
				rattles, strollers, and the “Go the F*** to Bed” book, they more 
				subtly spread them about:</p>
				<p>“Then we started mixing in all these ads for things we knew 
				pregnant women would never buy, so the baby ads looked random. 
				We’d put an ad for a lawn mower next to diapers. We’d put a 
				coupon for wineglasses next to infant clothes. That way, it 
				looked like all the products were chosen by chance.</p>
				<p>“And we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she 
				hasn’t been spied on, she’ll use the coupons. She just assumes 
				that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers 
				and cribs. As long as we don’t spook her, it works.”</p>
				<p>via How Companies Learn Your Secrets – NYTimes.com.</p>
				<p>So the Target philosophy towards expecting parents is similar 
				to the first date philosophy? Even if you’ve fully stalked the 
				person on Facebook and Google beforehand, pretend like you know 
				less than you do so as not to creep the person out.</p>
				<p>Duhigg suggests that Target’s gangbusters revenue growth — 
				$44 billion in 2002, when Pole was hired, to $67 billion in 2010 
				— is attributable to Pole’s helping the retail giant corner the 
				baby-on-board market, citing company president Gregg Steinhafel 
				boasting to investors about the company’s “heightened focus on 
				items and categories that appeal to specific guest segments such 
				as mom and baby.”</p>
				<p>Target was none too happy about Duhigg’s plans to write this 
				story. They refused to let him go to Target headquarters. When 
				he flew out anyway, he discovered he was on a list of prohibited 
				visitors.</p>
				<p>I think most readers of the excellent piece will find it both 
				unsettling and unsurprising. With all the talk these days about 
				the data grab most companies are engaged in, Target’s collection 
				and analysis seem as expected as its customers’ babies. But with 
				their analysis moving into areas as sensitive as pregnancy, and 
				so accurately, who knows how else they might start profiling 
				Target shoppers? The store’s bulls-eye logo may now send a 
				little shiver of fear down the closely-watched spines of some, 
				though I can promise you that Target is not the only store doing 
				this. Those people chilled by stores’ tracking and profiling 
				them may want to consider going the way of the common criminal — 
				and paying for far more of their purchases in cash.</p>
