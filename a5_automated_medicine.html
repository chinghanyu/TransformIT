				<h3>Do We Need Doctors Or Algorithms?</h3>
				<p>By Vinod Khosla. Founding CEO of Sun Microsystems. Co-founder 
				of Daisy Systems.<br />
				</p>
				<p>I was asked about a year ago at a talk about energy what I 
				was doing about the other large social problems, namely health 
				care and education. Surprised, I flippantly responded that the 
				best solution was to get rid of doctors and teachers and let 
				your computers do the work, 24/7 and with consistent quality.</p>
				<p>Later, I got to cogitating about what I had said and why, and 
				how embarrassingly wrong that might be. But the more I think 
				about it the more I feel my gut reaction was probably right. The 
				beginnings of “Doctor Algorithm” or Dr. A for short, most likely 
				(and that does not mean “certainly” or “maybe”) will be much 
				criticized. We’ll see all sorts of press wisdom decrying “they 
				don’t work” or “look at all the silly things they come up with.” 
				But Dr. A will get better and better and will go from providing 
				“bionic assistance” to second opinions to assisting doctors to 
				providing first opinions and as referral computers (with 
				complete and accurate synopses and all possible hypotheses of 
				the hardest cases) to the best 20% of the human breed doctors. 
				And who knows what will happen beyond that?</p>
				<h3>Assessing Current Healthcare</h3>
				<p>Let’s start with healthcare (or sickcare, as many 
				knowledgeable people call it). Think about what happens when you 
				visit a doctor. You have to physically go to the hospital or 
				some office, where you wait (with no real predictability for how 
				long), and then the nurse probably takes you in and checks your 
				vitals. Only after all this does the doctor show up and, after 
				some friendly banter, asks you to describe your own symptoms. 
				The doctor assesses them and hunts around (probably in your 
				throat or lungs) for clues as to their source, provides the 
				diagnosis, writes a prescription, and sends you off.</p>
				<p>The entire encounter should take no more than 15 minutes and 
				usually takes probably less than that. Sometimes a test or two 
				may be ordered, if you can afford it. And, as we all know, most 
				of the time, it turns out to be some routine diagnosis with a 
				standard treatment... something a computer algorithm could do 
				if the treatment involved no harm, or at least do as well as the 
				median doctor (I am not talking about the top 20% of doctors 
				here—80% of doctors are below the “top 20%” but that is hard for 
				people to intuit!).</p>
				<p>So what’s wrong with this situation? This is by no means an 
				exhaustive list, but it sets up a nice springboard:</p>
				<p>Physically having to go to your doctor’s office makes sense for 
				the most part, except that a lot of the basic tests are either 
				visual (tongue and throat check) or auditory (listening to the 
				breath and vibrations in the abdomen). Time plus cost will often 
				discourage people from taking that first step to visit a doctor. 
				Most of the time a Dr. A could at least advise you when it is 
				worth visiting based on your normal body functions, your current 
				indications, and your locality’s current infections and other 
				symptom trends.
				A lot of the vitals being tested for (e.g. blood pressure, 
				pulse) can now be routinely done at home or even with the help 
				of an iPhone and an explosion of additional possibilities will 
				emerge in the next decade. </p>
				<h3>You are the one telling the doctor your symptoms.</h3>
				<p>The doctor has to inquire (probably every time) into any 
				possible history of each symptom, test results, and illnesses, 
				except when he does not have time for you in that village in 
				India.
				The prescriptions are still done on paper, requiring you to, 
				again, physically go to a pharmacy and pick up what you need 
				there. So compliance is an issue.</p>
				<p>Looking at this, I cannot help but think that this is a 
				completely antiquated system (regardless of whether it is 
				healthcare or not)!</p>
				<p>Going down the list, we find a pretty negative assessment. The 
				vital signs could all be determined with the help of mobile 
				devices, the operation of which do not require years of training 
				and a certification. You will be able to do this by 
				yourself—Philips already is using the iPhone camera to try to 
				measure vital indicators, others will be even more innovative 
				and as an insurance company it would be cost-effective to give 
				them to every insured person for free. Skin Scan is measuring 
				your risk of skin cancer from a photograph of a skin lesion. 
				Telemedicine is accelerating and a Qualcomm company is measuring 
				heart rates using an iPhone. Cell phones that display your vital 
				signs and take ultrasound images of your heart or abdomen are in 
				the offing as well as genetic scans of malignant cells that 
				match your cancer to the most effective treatment. Ear infection 
				and skin rash pictures and more will all be mobile phone based, 
				often supplemented by the kind of (fractal) analysis that Skin 
				Scan does, and more than what the doctors naked eye could 
				usually see.</p>
				<p>The history of symptoms, illnesses, and test results could be 
				accessed, processed, and assessed by a computer to see any 
				correlation or trends with the patient’s past. You are the one 
				providing the doctor with the symptoms anyway after all!</p>
				<p>Any follow-up hunts for clues could again be done with mobile 
				devices. The prescriptions—along with the medical records—could 
				relocate to electronic and digital methods, saving paper, 
				reducing bureaucracy, and easing the healing process. If 90% of 
				the time the doctor knows exactly the right kind of diagnosis 
				from these very few and superficial inputs (we haven’t even 
				considered genetics yet!), does it really require 10+ years of 
				intense education for every diagnostician?</p>
				<p>The fault is not entirely with the doctors, though. Most of us 
				don’t know what set of symptoms warrant the full-scale attention 
				of medical personnel, so we either go all the time or we do not 
				go at all (save for emergencies). We also cannot realistically 
				expect any (even our family) doctor to remember every single 
				symptom and test result over the years, definitely not in a 
				government hospital in China. Similarly, we cannot expect our 
				doctor to be able to remember everything from medical school 
				twenty years ago or memorize the whole Physicians Desk Reference 
				(PDR) and to know everything from the latest research, and so on 
				and so forth. This is why, every time I visit the doctor, I like 
				to get a second opinion. I do my Internet research and feel much 
				better.</p>
				<h3>Identifying Emerging Trends In Healthcare</h3>
				<p>But I always wonder why I cannot input my specific test numbers 
				and have a system offer me a “second opinion” on the diagnosis 
				since it has all the data that the doctor has and can use all my 
				current and historical data effectively. In fact, it is not hard 
				to imagine it having more data than the doctor has since my full 
				patient record would be at the tip of its digital brain, unlike 
				the average doctor who probably doesn’t remember my blood 
				glucose levels or my ferritin from two years ago. He does not 
				remember all the complex correlations from med school in which 
				ferritin matters—there are three thousand or more metabolic 
				pathways, I was once told, in the human body and they impact 
				each other in very complex ways. These tasks are perfect for a 
				computer to model as “systems biology” researchers are trying to 
				do.</p>
				<p>Add to it my baseline numbers from when I was not sick, which 
				most doctors don’t have and if they did 80% of physicians would 
				be too lazy to use or not know how to use. Applied Proteomics 
				can extract tens of gigabytes of proteomics—what my genes are 
				actually doing instead of what they can do—baseline data from 
				one drop of blood. Oh, by the way I have my 23andMe data to add 
				my genetic propensities (howsoever imprecise today, but 
				improving rapidly with time and more data). The doctor uses a 
				lot of imprecise judgments too as most good doctors will readily 
				admit. My very good doctor did not check that I have relative 
				insensitivity, genetically, to Metformin, a diabetes drug. It is 
				easy to input the PDR (the Physicians Desk Reference), the 
				massively thick, small-font book that all physicians are 
				supposed to know backwards and forwards. They often don’t 
				remember everything they read, in med school but it is a piece 
				of cake for computers. The book on your typical doctor’s desk is 
				probably not current on the leading-edge science either. 
				Confirmed science and emerging science are different things and 
				each has a role. Doctors mostly use confirmed science, the 
				average doctor not understanding and pros and cons of each or 
				the expected value of a treatment (benefit and harm). And our 
				18th century tradition of “first do no harm” dictates that if a 
				treatment hurts ten patients a year but saves a thousand lives 
				we reject it.</p>
				<p>With enough examples, today’s techniques for language 
				translation (or newer techniques) can translate from human lingo 
				for symptoms (“I feel itchy” or “buzzy” or “reddish bubbly rash 
				with pimples” or “less energy in the morning” or “sort of a 
				stretch in my tendon” and the myriad of imprecise ways symptoms 
				are described and results interpreted — these are highly 
				amenable to big data analysis) into medical lingo matching the 
				PDR. With easy input of real medical results into a computer and 
				long-standing historical data per patient and per population, 
				which a human cannot possibly handle, and patient and population 
				genetics, I suspect getting a second opinion of my diagnosis 
				from Dr. A is a reasonable expectation, and it should certainly 
				be better than a middling physician’s (especially in less 
				developed countries like India, where there is a dire shortage 
				of trained physicians).</p>
				<p>I may still need a surgeon (though robotic surgeons like those 
				from Intuitive Surgical are on the way too) or other specialists 
				for some tasks for a little while and the software may move from 
				“second opinion” (in three years? Or seven?) to “bionic 
				software” for the physicians (in five or ten years, with enough 
				patient data?). Bionic software, again, defined here as software 
				which augments and amplifies human understanding.</p>
				<p>But I doubt very much if within 10-15 years (given continued 
				investment and innovation and keeping the AMA from quashing such 
				efforts politically) I won’t be able to ask Siri’s great great 
				grandchild (Version 9.0?) for an opinion far more accurate than 
				the one I get today from the average physician. Instead of 
				asking Siri 9.0, “I feel like sushi” or “where can I dispose a 
				body” (try it…it’s fairly accurate!) and with your iPhone X or 
				Android Y with all the power of IBM’s current Watson computer in 
				the mobile phone and an even more powerful “nVidia times 10-100” 
				server which will cost far less than med school with terabytes 
				or petabytes of data on hundreds of millions (billions?) of 
				patients, including their complete genomics and proteomics (each 
				sample costing about the same as a typical blood test).</p>
				<p>IBM’s Watson computer, I understand, is now being applied to 
				medical diagnosis after handling imprecise and vague tasks like 
				winning at Jeopardy, which experts a few years ago would have 
				said could not be done. “Computers cannot match the judgment of 
				humans on these kinds of tasks!” And with enough data, medical 
				diagnosis or 90% of it is an easier task than Jeopardy.</p>
				<p>Already Kaiser Permanent already has 10 million real-time 
				medical records with details of 30,000,000 e-visits last year 
				with caregivers and computer modeling of key diseases per 
				individual that data scientists would love to get their hand on. 
				Already, according to IDC 14% of the US population is using 
				their phones for medical help and 200 million health and fitness 
				related mobile applications have been downloaded according to 
				pyramid research. Fun stuff, though early. They are probably two 
				generations away from systems that are actually useful.</p>
				<p>A more elaborate vision, one that is not very useful today 
				because of lack of enough data and enough science, is defined in 
				Experimental Man and websites like Quantified Self. Though they 
				feel like toys today, they are much further along than the 
				mobile phone was pre-iPhone in January of 2007. And data, the 
				key ingredient to useful analysis, and diagnosis, is starting to 
				explode exponentially—be it genetic data, proteomic data or 
				physical data about my steps, my exercises, my stress levels or 
				my normal heart and respiration rates.</p>
				<p>My UP wristband or something like it (disclosure: I am an 
				investor in Jawbone) will know all my sleep patterns when I am 
				healthy and how many steps I take each day and may have more 
				data on my mobility if I ever get depressed than any 
				psychiatrist ever will know what to do with. Within a few years, 
				my band will know my heart rate at all times, my respiration 
				rate, my galvanic skin resistance (one parameter among multiple 
				ones used to measure my stress level), my metabolic rate (should 
				cost about $10 to add to the band by measuring my CO<sub>2</sub> in my 
				breath and may detect changes in my body chemistry too like when 
				I get a certain type of cancer and traces of it show up in my 
				breath).</p>
				<p>All my “health data” as well as my “sick data” and my “activity 
				data” will be accessible to Dr. A (and location when I was 
				stressed or breathing hard or getting the allergic reaction and 
				what chemicals were nearby or in the air—did toluene exposure 
				cause me to break out in a rash from that new carpet or trigger 
				a systemic reaction from my body?). I doubt I will be prescribed 
				an arthritis medicine without Dr. A knowing my genetics and the 
				genetics of my autoimmune disease. Or a cancer medicine without 
				the genetics of my cancer when the genetic sequence (once per 
				life) costs far less than a single dose of medicine. In fact all 
				my infectious disease treatments may be based on analysis of my 
				full genome and my history of exposure to viruses, bacteria and 
				toxic chemicals.</p>
				<p>Constant everyday health data from non-medical devices will 
				swamp the “sickness tests” used in most medical diagnosis and be 
				supplemented by detailed genetic, proteomic and sick data with 
				bionic software and machine learning systems. Siri might even 
				remind me one day that my heart rate while sleeping has gone up 
				abnormally over the last year, so I should go run some heart 
				sickness cardiograms or imaging tests. Obviously, Siri’s 
				children and its server friends will be able to keep up with the 
				latest research and decide on optimal strategies based on 
				patient preference (“I prefer to live longer even if it means 
				all the fancy treatments” or “I want to live a normal life and 
				die. I prefer to spend more of my time with my children than at 
				the hospital” or “I like taking risky treatments”). They will 
				take into account known research, early pioneering approaches, 
				very complex interrelationships and much more.</p>
				<p>My best guess is that today a physician’s bias makes all these 
				personal decisions for patients in a majority of the cases 
				without the patient (or sometimes even the physician) realizing 
				what “preferences “ are being incorporated into their 
				recommendations. The situation gets worse the less educated or 
				economically less well-off the patient is, such as in developing 
				countries, in my estimation.</p>
				<h3>Envisioning Future Healthcare</h3>
				<p>Eventually, we won’t need the average doctor and will have much 
				better and cheaper care for 90-99% of our medical needs. We will 
				still need to leverage the top 10 or 20% of doctors (at least 
				for the next two decades) to help that bionic software get 
				better at diagnosis. So a world mostly without doctors (at least 
				average ones) is not only not reasonable, but also more likely 
				than not. There will be exceptions, and plenty of stories around 
				these exceptions, but what I am talking about will most likely 
				be the rule and doctors may be the exception rather than the 
				other way around.</p>
				<p>However fictionalized, we will be aiming to produce doctors like 
				Gregory House who solve biomedical puzzles beyond our best input 
				ability. And India, China and other countries may not have to 
				worry about the investment in massive healthcare or massive 
				inequalities in the type of physicians they might have access 
				to. And hopefully our bionic software (or independent software 
				someday) will be free of the influence of heavily marketed but 
				only minimally effective drugs or treatment regimes or branding 
				campaigns against generics or lower-cost and equally effective, 
				more affordable drugs and treatments. Dr. A will be able to do a 
				cost optimization too both at the patient level and at the 
				policy level (but we may choose, at least for a decade or two, 
				to reject its recommendations—we will still be free to be stupid 
				or political).</p>
				<p>What is important to realize is how medical education and the 
				medical profession will change toward the better as a result of 
				these trends. The vision I am proposing here, though, is one in 
				which those decades of learning and experience are used where 
				they actually matter. We consider doctors some of the most 
				learned people in our society. We should aim to use their time 
				and knowledge in the most efficient manner possible. And 
				everybody should have access to the skills of the very best ones 
				instead of only having access to the average doctor. And the not 
				so “Dr. House’ doctors will help us with better patient skills, 
				bedside manners, empathy, advice and caring, and they will have 
				more time for that too. If computers can drive cars and deal 
				with all the knowledge in jeopardy, surely their next to next to 
				next…generation can do diagnosis, treatment and teaching in 
				these far less uncertain domains and with a lot more data. 
				Further the equalizing impact of both electronic doctors and 
				teaching environments has hugely positive social implications. 
				Besides, who wants to be treated by an “average” doctor? And who 
				does not want to be an empowered patient?</p>
				<p>The best way to predict this future is not to extrapolate the 
				past and what has or has not worked, but to invent the future we 
				want, the one we believe possible!</p>
