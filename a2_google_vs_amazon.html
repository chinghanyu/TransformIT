				<h3>A New Google Venture, and Another Web Boundary Line Is Nudged</h3>
				<p>NY Times December 1, 2011</p>
				<p>In another foray into commerce, Google is working on a 
				delivery service that would let people order items from local 
				stores on the Web and receive them at their homes or offices 
				within a day.</p>
				<p>The service is in an early testing phase, and it was 
				described by three people briefed on the project who were not 
				authorized to speak about it publicly before it was announced. 
				It is part of a bigger, strategic effort by Google to move 
				beyond its core search business by helping people buy things, 
				not just find them.</p>
				<p>Other parts of this strategy include Google Wallet to make 
				payments by cellphone, Google Offers for daily deals, apps that 
				show location-based mobile ads and product[s] search for local 
				stores.</p>
				<p>The idea behind the new delivery service is that people 
				searching for products online or on their phones could buy 
				something from a local retailer or the local branches of 
				nationwide chains, and could then take the next step — delivery 
				— through Google.</p>
				<p>Google does not intend to build stores or warehouses or 
				become a retailer itself, two of the people briefed on the 
				delivery service said. Instead, it is talking with potential 
				partners, including retailers and possibly couriers.</p>
				<p>The service is the latest example of how the biggest tech 
				companies — including Google, Apple, and Amazon — are trying to 
				branch out and, in the process, blurring the lines between their 
				core businesses.</p>
				<p>For example, Apple’s iTunes business is formidable, and much 
				of its success in selling phones and tablets, which compete with 
				Google’s Android and Chrome devices, comes from its retail 
				stores. And shoppers increasingly search Amazon directly, 
				instead of looking first for products on Google, in part because 
				of Amazon’s Prime program, which offers free two-day shipping 
				for a $79 annual fee. Amazon also operates AmazonFresh, a local 
				delivery service focused on groceries, in Seattle.</p>
				<p>“Google is arguably at a competitive disadvantage because 
				consumers view Amazon and maybe eBay as guaranteeing over all a 
				higher-quality shopping experience, and retail ads are almost 
				half of Google’s business,” said Eric Best, chief executive of 
				Mercent, which does online advertising and e-commerce on Google, 
				Amazon, and other sites for 400 brands.</p>
				<p>Google wants to use mobile phones and the Web to connect 
				shoppers with merchants, both online and offline, and benefit by 
				selling ads to merchants, one of the people briefed on the 
				project said. Eventually, Google hopes, the delivery service 
				would be integrated into Android mobile devices and Google Plus, 
				another person said.</p>
				<p>If Google decides to move forward with it, the service would 
				start in a few cities, including San Francisco and New York, one 
				person said.</p>
				<p>It is unclear whether Google would take a cut of the revenue 
				from sales or make money only on merchant ads. Google does not 
				take a portion of payments with the Google Wallet mobile app, 
				but it does earn money from sales of Google Offers.</p>
				<p>Local online and mobile ads are a growing revenue source for 
				many companies, including Google, Amazon, Groupon, and Yelp.</p>
				<p>Local digital advertising revenue will be $23 billion this 
				year, just 17 percent of total local ad revenue, but the portion 
				will grow to 25 percent by 2015, according to BIA/Kelsey, a 
				local media research firm. Local advertising contributes heavily 
				to Google’s biggest businesses; local search ad revenue, now $6 
				billion annually, is growing 10 percent year over year, and more 
				than half of mobile ads are local.</p>
				<p>The new delivery service, which was first reported by The 
				Wall Street Journal, fits squarely into Google’s broader efforts 
				to use its search engine to connect merchants and shoppers.</p>
				<p>In the last year, it has enhanced its product search and 
				introduced new ad formats for retailers. It now shows sites that 
				carry an item and compares prices and shipping fees, and 
				connects with stores’ inventory feeds to show where the item is 
				in stock nearby. The new service would be an extension of that.</p>
				<p>With Google Offers, the company sells daily deals for local 
				businesses. In October, it began testing Google Trusted Stores, 
				which verifies e-commerce sites as trusted retailers, based on 
				shipping and customer service. Google promises to refund the 
				purchase price or replace items for shoppers dissatisfied with a 
				trusted store’s service. And with Google Wallet, people can pay 
				for items online or offline with their phones.</p>
				<p>Perhaps Google’s biggest hurdle in competing with companies 
				like Amazon and Apple in becoming a commerce business is 
				collecting credit card numbers, which enables quick purchases of 
				things as diverse as digital music and offline goods. Apple has 
				said in the past that it has more than 225 million credit card 
				numbers, and Amazon has the credit card information of tens of 
				millions of customers.</p>
				<p>“Privacy concerns notwithstanding, the best way to target a 
				consumer with relevant offers is based on their buying behavior 
				and purchase history,” Mr. Best said. “That’s another huge 
				strategic advantage for Google to participate in the 
				transaction.”</p>
