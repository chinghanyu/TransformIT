				<p><strong>Q5.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> What properties 
				characterize Executive Information Systems (EIS)? <strong>b.</strong> 
				Read
				<a href="a3_giving_the_boss_the_big_picture.html" target="_blank">
				the article on EIS</a>, and explain why EIS dashboards are 
				appropriate for the CEO’s. <strong>c.</strong> From the same 
				article, explain how Verizon is using dashboards, containing 
				what information. <strong>d.</strong> How can you use EIS 
				dashboards in your business? What variables would you include?<br />
				<strong>A5.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> An Executive 
				Information System is characterized by text inputs to a database 
				which are then processed into statistics and graphs dynamically. 
				An EIS displays small chunks of aggregated and summarized 
				information that can be dynamically updated using repeating 
				queries to a main database.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> EIS Dashboards are appropriate for Chief 
				Executive Officers because it brings the basic details about the 
				operations of the company to their fingertips. It also allows 
				them to drill down on any particular statistic and make 
				decisions based on the trends shown.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> Verizon’s CEO Ivan Seidenberg can choose 
				from over 300 metrics to put on his dashboard. Some options are 
				broadband sales and wireless subscription defectors.</p>
				<p><strong>d.</strong> In the business of Technical Consulting, 
				some useful metrics to include on a dashboard are: Number of 
				customers per service, number of hours of work per location, and 
				revenue per service. Monitoring the metrics above can give 
				insight into which services are performing and how well. An EIS 
				System can be used in this field in order to monitor service 
				popularity and service center incomes so that the CEO can 
				evaluate whether any particular service or service center should 
				be maintained and what the corresponding prices should be.</p>
				<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Browse an e-book at
				<a href="http://library.books24x7.com" target="_blank">
				http://library.books24x7.com</a> or at
				<a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu" target="_blank">
				http://www.library.cornell.edu</a>, or at
				<a href="http://www.globusz.com" target="_blank">
				http://www.globusz.com</a>. <strong>a.</strong> Briefly describe 
				what book you browsed. How can the quality of reading be 
				improved by using augmented reality? Give an example related to 
				that book. <strong>b.</strong> Ingram executives believe that 
				digital distribution of books is more important than online 
				reading. Describe how book distributors like Ingram can 
				accomplish digital distribution, without going into e-book 
				retail business. <strong>c.</strong> Why is Ingram not moving 
				more aggressively into digital distribution of physical books? 
				Could channel conflict be one of their concerns? Explain.<br />
				<strong>A6.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> The e-Book browsed was 
				Case in Point on a Kindle App on an Android phone and Google 
				Chrome on a PC. Given the educational and employment related 
				nature of the book, the inclusion of case interview videos would 
				enhance the quality of reading. Being able to watch the conduct 
				of an interviewee in a case interview situation would add more 
				to the tips than simply reading about the suggested behavior. 
				One step further, adding interactive responses to practice 
				questions would allow the reader to practice case questions with 
				a computer programmed to supply the interviewer responses for a 
				realistic experience.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> Book distributors can move into the 
				digital distribution with the help of machines such as 
				Espresso’s Print-on-demand machines. With such technology 
				locally available, book distributors can electronically ship 
				books and manuscripts to be printed on demand. This saves them 
				the cost of holding inventory and shipping books. This is 
				different from going into the e-book retail business because the 
				books distributed are physical products. Only the delivery 
				method is handled electronically.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> Yes, Channel Conflict is one of the 
				reasons that Ingram books is not aggressively pursuing digital 
				distribution. Since Ingram is a book distributor, it has two 
				channels of income: bookstores (physical products) and digital 
				distribution. In this case, one of the income channels (physical 
				bookstores) is threatened by the increase in popularity of the 
				other. For this reason, physical stores have threatened to 
				withhold business from Ingram books if they pursue espresso 
				printing machines.</p>
				<p><strong>Q7.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Can sharing of a 
				digital product by consumers be beneficial to the sellers of 
				that product? List your reasons, and briefly explain. <strong>b.</strong> 
				Read the article titled “Disintermediating Cable TV”, and 
				explain how the comedian Louis C.K. is bypassing the TV 
				networks. Explain if any of the reasons you gave in part a apply 
				to him. <strong>c.</strong> Can site licenses benefit software 
				makers? Give one reason and briefly explain. <strong>d.</strong> 
				Explain if you would encourage sharing of your products in your 
				business and why. If you do not have digital products, give an 
				example of another business where sharing of a product by the 
				consumers may benefit the seller and explain why.<br />
				<strong>A7.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Yes it can. Sharing of 
				digital products by consumers can propagate positive network 
				effects for that product. As more people gain access to the 
				digital product, the popularity will grow and so will its value. 
				This is particularly true if the product is priced way below the 
				reservation price for most customers. The convenience of digital 
				delivery and download at a low cost will eventually overcome the 
				convenience sharing with other consumers.</p>
				<p><strong>b.</strong> The comedian Louis C. K. bypasses most 
				intermediaries in his “supply chain”, i.e. he writes, directs, 
				films and composes his comedy acts all by himself. Furthermore, 
				by supplying his own acts for direct download from his website, 
				he is bypassing TV networks and reaching consumers by himself.</p>
				<p><strong>c.</strong> Site licenses benefit the makers of the 
				software by allowing them to charge more per license. Since a 
				site license by definition allows multiple users, the 
				reservation price of each individual buyer (i.e. site of 
				organization) increases greatly. In most cases selling a site 
				license will bring in more money for ‘x’ number of people than 
				an individual license for each of those ‘x’.</p>
				<p><strong>d.</strong> Based on personal experience, the sharing 
				of kindle books (digital products) would enhance business for 
				the seller, and the experience for the reader. Amazon Kindle 
				books were introduced to me through a sampler for a book I was 
				waiting for. Since the format of the e-book was specific ( 
				amazon kindle), it becomes necessary for me to download the 
				compatible software. Once I had experience using the kindle for 
				free, I was more inclined to pay for the digital products than 
				before sharing. Essentially, sharing of digital media can 
				propagate positive network effects for the digital media.</p>
				<p><strong>Q8.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> Use Google Maps to 
				find the directions to a golf course in Ithaca from your address 
				(or the directions to some other business in some other city 
				from the airport). <strong>b.</strong> Take the Google 
				directions, and superimpose your own graphical directions on top 
				of it, to the same golf course (or another business), because 
				Google directions are often wrong due to construction or road 
				closures. Use image editor to highlight the route from your 
				house to that golf course (or some other route). Save the 
				modified map on your web page. <strong>c.</strong> Locate a 
				picture of the golf course (or other business) on the web. Copy 
				it to your web folder. Create an image link between the map and 
				the picture of the golf course (or your business), so that when 
				the users click on the golf course location on the map, they see 
				a picture of the golf course. Alternatively, instead of <strong>
				a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, and <strong>c</strong> above, do
				<strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, and <strong>c</strong> 
				below. <strong>a.</strong> Signup for a photo management system 
				like flickr.com, slide.com, or picasa.com. Upload some of your 
				photos, and create an album or a slide show. <strong>b.</strong> 
				Provide a link to your album from your web page. <strong>c.</strong> 
				Geo-tag your photos. Geo-tagging involves hyperlinking each 
				photo to a specific location on a map, which shows where the 
				photo was taken. Hyperlinks can go in either direction.<br />
				<strong>A8.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> a Google Map direction 
				of Sage Hall is shown below.</p>

				Provide a link to your customized ad, or provide a print-screen.
				<strong>b.</strong> Insert a marquee (an animated scrolling 
				text) into your a3 page. Alternatively, insert a banner ad into 
				your a3 page. <strong>c.</strong> Explain why customization 
				maybe more important with digital goods than physical goods.
				<strong>d.</strong> Explain how customized recommendations may 
				lead to the long tail phenomenon.<br />
				<strong>A9.</strong> <strong>a.</strong> A custom design of a boot. The
